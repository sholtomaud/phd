# Literature Review

## What is Risk?

Risk is the product of probability and consequence



## Types of Risk

Identified below are many different types of risk associated with different disciplines and contexts.

* Static vs Dynamic -> asset changing risk status over time
* Risk Intensity/Density -> analogy which might be used to incorporate uncertainty
* Technical/Operational
* Compliance/Legal
* Bus Factor
* Political/social -> social license
* Strategic 
* Financial
* Model Risk
* Environmental/Health & Safety
* Data Quality Risk
* Reliability Engineering

### Hetrogenous methods

* Can we have one size fits all for a generic methodology?
* Do we need to select each risk method according to the scenario/context?
*

## Uncertainty and risk

1. How do we feed the uncertainty of our data into the associate risks
2. Are there different types of risk that need to be evaluated differently and fed into the risk calculation differently?
3. Is the typical risk matrix appropriate for all circumstances?
4. Should uncertainty only just accompany the risk as a second value?

## Visualisation of Risk

* Analogy of google maps with the uncertainty of the GPS location
* LatLong point is the estimated location, and the surrounding circle is the uncertainty of the location
* Could

## Title

### BigData and data-driven Systems for Visualising Risk Governance
#### With application to Unconventional Energy Production and Water Resources

## Doctoral Candidate 

Mr Sholto Maud

# INTRODUCTION AND CONTEXT
There are many database models in the water industry, both vendor-based and in-house. These different models provide an integration challenge when aiming to provide higher level services such as risking services. A translation is needed to bring different models them together into one system which can enable risk governance services. 

# RESEARCH QUESTION
Can we use big data, and data-driven interfaces to leverage risk governance requirements for water and unconventional energy production at reduced cost?

#### Hypotheses:
* That with NoSQL we can integrate different data models at reduced cost
* That with Node.js we can easily generate data-driven interfaces & risking services

# AIMS AND OBJECTIVES
The thesis is at the highest level an investigation into both system engineering and system design to accommodate the objective of integrating multiple data models for the purpose of risk governance in the unconventional energy industry.
The aims within this objective is to enable web services for risk governance of Capital (eco/water/financial) for legislators, stakeholders and unconventional energy companies. The types of risk under interest are:
* Cumulative risk
* Ecoservices risk
* Legal risk
* Compliance risk
* Financial risk

Within the goals under these aims are to generate: 
* Geopoint services, 2D and 3D, acquiring data from legacy systems
* Data models meta-translation service for schema integration
* Risk acquisition & attribution through forms & calculation services, turning risk into a timeseries
* Risk governance threshold acquisition and triggers
* 2D maps for proof of concept demonstration

# RESEARCH PLAN

As an investigation into both system engineering and design the research plan will cover both theoretical topics, covered in review articles, and practical tasks informed by the theory. 

Theoretical topics include Risk Assessment and how Assessment relates to Risk Governance in the unconventional energy industry. This will largely be undertaken through literature review with Gap analysis undertaken to inform the system design for the pratcial, technical component of system engineering.

Practical tasks will involve coding and deployment, requireing best practice in DevOps, Administration and coding BigData, NoSql and meta-translation systems. The main methods used in the practical aspect of the plan are the reactive development method combined with trial and error. The reactive development and trial and error methods are commonplace in various development houses within the I.T. industry providing a viable development program. 

These topics and tasks will be the subject of 5 articles and one literature review, each of which will comprise a chapter in the overall Thesis. Whilst the specific chapter headings and content may be subject to change, the proposed headings, and article titles are signifed with an asterix:

# RESOURCES & SKILLS 
The following skills will be required for the successful completion of the project:
* NoSQL
* Understanding of Effective Risk Governance Model
* Big Data Systems (MongoDB)
* Data analysis 
* Node.js
* Data driven interfaces
* DevOps

# BARRIERS TO SUCCESS
The main barriers to success will be skill & system development within timelines. Developing techniques for handling non-standardised data formats are significant challenges along with  engagement with Government agencies that are the source of these data model variability. Technical expertise will be developed during the course of the project to accommodated any skill gaps in Node.js and NoSQL systems.

# CONTRIBUTIONS TO KNOWLEDGE (THE STATEMENT OF ORIGINALITY)

The project will contribute further understanding the novel application of BigData, NoSQL, and data-driven interface technologies to hydrology & hydrogeology. It will establish more specific knowledge around the levels of cost and resource efficiencies that might be obtained in the use of such technologies to address stakeholder requirements when compared to legacy systems and development methods.

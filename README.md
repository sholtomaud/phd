# Visualisation of Dynamic Risk
Doctoral Thesis by Sholto Maud

## Analytic Goals
1. Investigate method for feeding uncertainty into risk calculations
2. Investigate method for evaluating dynamic risk

## Technical Goals
1. BigData systems for integration of data models
2. Establish webservices providing risked data 
3. Consume the risking webservices through a presentation layer & water atlas

# Preface

This PhD began with technical motivations to 

1. bring together a number of different technologies and databases that store water data
2. generate services which value add to those technologies

The latter of these motivations implied the analysis and generation of novel services such as providing risking of assets associated with unconventional energy resources such as Coal Seam Gas production (CGS)

The novel concept introduced within this technical framework is that of DYNAMIC RISK. Risk which changes over time. The concept of Dynamic Risk acknowledges that the components that go to makeup a risk calcualtion themselves change over time, which in turn makes risk a timeseries. 

As is elaborated in Chapter 2 of this work, included within dynamic risk calculations are consequence (measured in Dollars), probability, and uncertainty. Each of these can change as more or less information becomes available, or as other factors vary, such as changes in licensing values and allocations in response to prevailing climate conditions, such as a drought for example.

## Risk management frameworks

In the Terms of Reference for Activity 5 of the CSG Feasibility Study, a hybrid Groundwater Model and Multi Criteria Analysis (GMMCA) risk assessment methodology was developed [@Beckers2013].

## What is a risk management framework?

## Frameworks

Randall [-@Randall2012], called for an integrated framework which integrates both precautionary and OSM methods in what he calls STS - screening, pre-release testing, and post-release surveillance. The figure directly below is Randall's diagram depicting this process.

![Randall's STS](./images/Randall-STS.PNG)



If Randall's diagram is turned on it's side it resembles the V-model introduced by Rook for software project engineering [@Rook1986]. Rook's concept (see figure below) was subsequently adopted by the Systems Engineering community [@Mooz1997, @Mooz2001, @Estefan2007].

![Standard V-model](./images/Rook1986.PNG)

If we consider Randall's diagram of STS  analogous to the V-model used in Systems Engineering the it would be fortunate and perhaps assuring that legislative theory had produced a similar procedure as the well-established methods of Systems Engineering. Moreover Randall's analysis might gain more value from further considersideration.

The figure below shows a standard V-model. In the System's Engineering terminology, pre-release would be roughly equivalent to pre-implementation, the left arm of the 'V'. Screening equal to the requirements gathering and design phase of the left arm of the 'V'.. Post-release surveillance is post-implementation operations and maintenance in the right arm of the 'V'.

![Standard V-model](./images/V-model.png)

The notable difference between the Systems Engineering method and Randall's STS method is the intended realm of application. STS is aimed at a higher level of societal governance rather than a project mission execution. If the V-model from Systems Engineering were enhanced to be used as a governance tool, one might introduce a prohibition arrow in the pre-implementation phase. The figure below depicts this enhancement.

![V-governance Prohibition Model](./images/V-govern.png)

In placing prohibition on the left-arm of the 'V', we might also consider the governance aspect of the right-arm of the 'V' - what happens if the management systems fail? As noted above, the system is operating in a civil context, where the main reparations are conducted under MGM's. Hence we can extend the simple V-model further to depict the reparations required for civilians when operations go wrong as shown in the figure below.

![V-governance Make Good Model](./images/V-mg.png)

In order for the framework to achieve these goals, it is important that it provides
comprehensive references to the scientific information and data framework it intends on
using, or indeed any scientific information it has consulted. Demonstrable scientific
underpinning will assist in community and industry education, and improvement in
developing and implementing leading practices [@Hunter2013]. 

practical steps to measure, share and analyse environmental data across
jurisdictions [@ANEDO2013]. 



As noted in the Harmonisation Framework, QLD applies an adaptive management approach. In this approach, defined trigger thresholds are used to initiate the make-good process [@SCER2013, p.47]. 


## Strict Liability

With reference to the two recommendations made above, Taylor [Ibid] went on to suggest that where UE producers use water resources, they should carry the costs associated with any impacts from activities. This view concurs with the views of landholders, who wish to receive appropriate compensation and payments [@VFF2013, ]. 

Strict liability is the imposition of liability on a party without a finding of fault. The question is whether UE producers have  would therefore be afforded to the tortfeasor. 

In this context the NWC recommended that bonds and sureties should deal with uncertainty and the timeframes associated with potential impacts [@NWC2010]. As the NWC noted, these time frames may potentially extend past 100 years, which is well-beyond the expected life-span of the CSG recovery process.

"This includes impacts such as long-term reductions in adjacent aquifer pressures and levels, and impacts on environmental assets that are not adequately protected by current ‘make good’ mechanisms" [@NWC2010].

"risk assessment model must include a definition of ‘unacceptable impacts’ to the environment and human health and any projects falling in this category should not be allowed to proceed. Risk assessment should not be undertaken by the proponent but by an independent third party."  ... “Verification of key system elements” should not rely on appraisal by “in house
representatives” but rather only “independent third-party professional[s]”. [@Boudicca2013]

## Connection between Risk, Liability and Make Good

"At the project level, the cumulative effects of many wells across the landscape will challenge the
feasibility of making good. Another challenge arises because the impacts on aquifers are likely to play
out on a time-scale of many decades and perhaps centuries, whereas the time-scale of CSG extraction
is shorter."



"At the basin level, which really matters in the CSG case where so much of the action will impact the GAB, the cumulative impacts over several centuries are (I would argue) near-impossible to predict."
 [@Randall2012, p.154]. 

This introduces both cumulative impacts, and uncertainty into the risk assessment.

### Cumulative Effects

As noted by the National Water Comission (NWC), in the context of groundwater, these costs may have the potential to persist beyond the life cycle of the UE production.

This raises concern over the temporal extent of liability. The tort "civil wrong". The term "cumulative effect" is used to conceptualise this temporal extent of liability. 

Cumulative effects are effects that are successive or incremental over time [@Howe2010]. Whilst Taylor's discussion was framed within the context of negative effects, the concept of cumulative effect was designed not to have pejorative content, but to recognise that cumulative effects on society, the economy and the environment can be conceived as either positive or negative, or a combination of the two at any one time. 

In a legal context, this raises the question of whether such cumulative effects are held as unavoidable, or whether liability is *res ipsa loquitur*: That is, where negligence is attributed by the evidence of cumulative impact, rather than by breach of duty [@Schremmer2011]. 

The resolution of this question has legal consequence in the calculation of risk, and in the perceived risk, since the granting the status of unavoidable, would appear to reduce liability claims by the plaintiff, and the associated risk of the operation. 

The notion of scaling precautionary, or corrective (so-called "make good") actions in response to information is encompassed in the concept of Adaptive Environmental Management (AEM). In the context of groundwater a Groundwater Model Multi Criteria Analysis (GMMCA) was proposed as an enhanced a Multi Criteria Analysis (MCA) designed to incorporate geological, hydrological, environmental and economic attributes within the AEM paradigm [@Beckers2013]. Both the GMMCA, and the concept of scaling precaution have the intent to enable regulatory flexibility, and to refine and improve risk mapping over time [@Beckers2013]. 

For Taylor precautionary measures be scaled according to information available about impacts [@Taylor2012, p.11]. As a part of this flexibility, Beckers et al recommend that adaptive methodologies include the temporal aspect within risk assessment [@Beckers2013, p.iii], with the ability to track long term effects. This type of recommendation implies a long term monitoring effort with associated hydrology data storage technologies for meta-data, and timeseries data. And in addition to these usual types of data, the temportal aspect of risk should also thereofre be stored. 

The attempt to integrate these enhancements in Australia has highlighted legislative and technical gaps. It is the intention of this review to document some of these gaps as noted in the literature, and within the technical community. Finally, potential solutions are proposed as a goals for future research with specific interest in the visualisation of risk as a management tool.

## Proposed Legislative Enhancements

## Risk Management 

The Purple Book [@Stoffen2005]

Risk management broadly considered consists of risk identification and analysis, evaluation and control [@Baker1998]. Randall has suggested that the spectrum of risk management strategies has the precautionary principle at one pole, and ordinary risk management (ORM) at the other. This spectrum might be characterised as a risk-control trade off [@Manjón2004], where the precautionary strategy maximizes control by minimizing risk with a potential repression of innovation, and the ORM strategy maximizes utility by accepting increased risk of failure, or even a continuing sequence of disasters [@Randall2012, p.157].

"The distinction between ORM and precautionary approaches lies less in the risk management tools that may be invoked, but in the assessment of risk, the decision rules applied and the timing of intervention."" [@Randall2012, p.158]. 

Model uncertainty and "unknown unknowns" provides a difficulty to OSM, which as Randall states, ".. is built upon the paradigm case of well-specified games of chances in which outcome possibilities are known, as are their probabilities" [@Randall2012, p.158]. When probabilities are not known due to uncertainty, then the precautionary approach appears to win.

An incremental where we start with the precautionary at the top of the V and then descending down the left arm is the prohibition arm.  The deployment arm is the monitoring and verification arm. Once the system is in this phase, any failure will generate an impact which will need a risk management tool to come into effect, with the associated costs.

ORM aims to "defer risk-management intervention" & "unconvincing responses to the challenge of
low-probability, high-damage threats.""
[@Randall2012, p.158]. 

## Risk management tools
The toolkit for managing private risks may still be organised into Ehrlich and Becker’s classic
categories of market insurance, self-insurance and self-protection.7 

* Market insurance: individuals and firms buy insurance policies 
* Self-insurance: firm sets aside resources sufficient to survive losses
* Self-protection: measures that prevent or mitigate bad outcomes

Make Good is one of the risk management tools. However it is not 

The risks cited in the literature are tabulated below:

|#|Asset at Risk | Hazard | Source | Reference |
|:----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|1.|Aquifer |Disturbance and irreparable damage| Construction |[@Randall2012, p.155]|
|2.|Groundwater |Methane migration | Operations |[@Randall2012, p.155]|

#### Make Good Agreements (MGA) and Make Good Measures (MGM)

"A make good agreement is an arrangement between a tenure holder and water bore owner" [@EHP2013, p.2]. Make good measures applies if the relevant authority believes that a bore is impaired. A make good measure is the measure a petroleum tenure holder will take if a bore has an impaired capacity. [@EHP2013, p.2]. An impairment will (should) be documents in a bore report, and can be when a bore no longer supplies a reasonable quantity or quality of water for its authorised use or purpose, with the ultimate arbiter being the governing chief executive [@QSG].

But what should the make-good measure be? As noted by Randall [-@Randall2012], MGMs were intended as *in-kind* reparations for any impacts. EHP suggested these measures could include works on a bore, such as deepening, where the costs of works are borne by the petroleum tenure holder (PTH) [@EHP2013]. Or, alternately, the PTH may provide the water bore owner monetary compensation as the MGM. 

#### Make Good Risk in Unit Technical Cost

For landholders and the PTH, the dollar consequence of any impairment to a bore is quantified in the MGM. Hence the risk, in this instance is the probability of the impairment, and the MGM dollar cost: 

If the symbol for risk is $$ \mathit{\bar{R}} $$, we will symbolise Make Good Risk with a subscript $$ \mathit{\bar{R}_{MG}} $$ 

Probability of Impairment is $$ \mathit{P}_{I} $$ 

Dollar Consequence, or Cost of Make Good Measure is $$ \mathit{C}_{MGM} $$  

Then:

$$ \mathit{R}_{MG} = \mathit{P}(\mathit{I}) \bullet \mathit{C}_{MGM} $$

For simplicity sake, when calculating the Unit Technical Cost (UTC) of operations, C_MGM is set to the dollar value of the groundwater bore license. MGM works on the bore may exceed the license value in some cases, however some impairments are difficult to predict *a priori*, and so the bore license value assumes *de facto* liability for UTC calculations. 

#### Make Good Reliability

Having derived the simple math above, we might also explore the inverse of make good risk ( $$ \mathit{\bar{R}_{MG}} })

$$ \mathit{\bar{R}_{MG}} = 1 - \mathit{R}_{MG} $$ 

This means that Make Good Risk is the inverse of Make Good Reliability. 

# Risk and Liability

There are gaps in the approaches above, the main issue in arriving at a unified risk framework appears to be: 
The gap identified by the literature appears to be the connection between GMMCA risk assessment and the make good measures. 

Whilst they have their place as a behavioral heuristic in the enforcement of safety procedures, the qualitative risk assessment methodology, with risk levels assigned through expert opinion, does not typically have a dollar value attached. This makes NPV and PV estimations of financial liability difficult to quantify. 






  

In the calculation above, Make Good Risk (R_MG) has a dollar value attached. In the case of repair works, the cost of MGM's can only truly be known *ex post facto*, for example, after an invoice has been received. -- [Footnote] To the knowledge of the author, there is no provision in the Harmonised Risk Management Framework (HRMF) for the recovery of data on MGM costs. This makes *post hoc* analysis a difficult task.-- However most stakeholders are not interested in *post hoc* analysis, but rather, the *ex ante* liability, the liability before the event to calculate ROI, and determine resource economics. 

This is especially the case for a PTH in the calculation of UTC, which typically includes decommissioning costs, and, in the case of CSG, any MGM costs. The default case mentioned above, of assigning C_MGM to the bore license value is one way of quantifying *ex ante* liability. Whether or not the license value has parity with MGM costs is moot, until such time as an MGM is fully executed. 

Pegging Make Good Risk to the bore license value transfers the burden of consequence calculation to the license issuer.

## Technical Context

The prevailing Technical Context (TC) might be characterised by three different approaches to the task of providing a data system capable of meeting the requirements of risk management.

``` 
1. in-house technical  
2. out-sourced vendor  
3. hybrid 

```

In #3, the hybrid situation, the data system is typically maintained by a team of subject experts together with a system administrator.


Whilst there are many data software applications currently available within the industry (Aquarius is one), typically at a State Government level the Hydstra(TM) data system developed and maintained by Kisters Pty Ltd, is the defacto standard for rainfall and stream level data. Some States or Local Government entities use different software systems, however Hydstra is predominantly the main system.  

Hydstra is also used at the national level within the BoM, however two other systems are also used; the in-house AWRIS2 developed as apart of the hydrographic modernisation project, and the WISKI(TM) system manufactured by the European branch of Kisters (Kisters AGM). 

The situation is a little more diverse when it comes to Groundwater and Water Quality. There are several systems such as Equis, EnviroSys, HydSys, and in Queensland there is the well-known Ground Water Database (GWDB) developed and maintainted in-house within the QLD NRM. An inventory of all the known systems is available below.

## Conclusions and Future Work

This review has focuses on the regulatory frameworks which have been concieved to provide effective management of the risks associated with Unconventional Energy production.

The design intent of the legislative concepts appears to necessitate a technical legislative framework to store and integrate many different dtata types over time. Such a framework is the main interest for future work. The three novel technical goals of that work envisiaged are; 

1. Proof of concept for a technical framework, which enables;
2. The integration of the temporal component of risk into precautionary and adaptive measures, and
3. The integration of model uncertainty into the calculation of risk.

## What is Risk?

Risk is the product of probability and consequence

The national water commission identified the following potential risks to sustainable water management:

Extracting large volumes of low-quality water will impact on connected surface and
groundwater systems, some of which may already be fully or overallocated, including the
Great Artesian Basin and Murray-Darling Basin.
Impacts on other water users and the environment may occur due to the dramatic
depressurisation of the coal seam, including:
o changes in pressures of adjacent aquifers with consequential changes in water
availability
o reductions in surface water flows in connected systems
o land subsidence over large areas, affecting surface water systems, ecosystems,
irrigation and grazing lands.
The production of large volumes of treated waste water, if released to surface water
systems, could alter natural flow patterns and have significant impacts on water quality, and
river and wetland health. There is an associated risk that, if the water is overly treated, ‘clean
water’ pollution of naturally turbid systems may occur.
The practice of hydraulic fracturing, or fraccing, to increase gas output, has the potential to
induce connection and cross-contamination between aquifers, with impacts on groundwater
quality.
The reinjection of treated waste water into other aquifers has the potential to change the
beneficial use characteristics of those aquifers. 
[@NWC2010]



## Types of Risk

Identified below are many different types of risk associated with different disciplines and contexts.

* Static vs Dynamic -> asset changing risk status over time
* Risk Intensity/Density -> analogy which might be used to incorporate uncertainty
* Technical/Operational
* Compliance/Legal
* Bus Factor
* Political/social -> social license
* Strategic 
* Financial
* Model Risk
* Environmental/Health & Safety
* Data Quality Risk
* Reliability Engineering

2. Are there different types of risk that need to be evaluated differently and fed into the risk calculation differently?
3. Is the typical risk matrix appropriate for all circumstances?
4. Should uncertainty only just accompany the risk as a second value?

"Uncertainty expresses the degree of belief analysts have
in their estimates. Uncertainty decreases as the quality of
data and understanding of the system improve. The initial estimates of failure rates or failure probability might
be based on comparison to similar equipment, historical
data (heritage), failure rate data from handbooks, or expert elicitation." [@NASA2007]

"Reliability estimates express probability of success.
 Uncertainty should be included with reliability estimates.
 Reliability estimates combined with FMEAs provide
additional and valuable information to aid in the decisionmaking
process" [@NASA2007]

## Technical methods


Maud (@Maud2015) identified methodological gaps regarding the assessment of risk for groundwater and coal seam gas operations. The aim of this paper is to integrate different risk assessment methods using analogous language to drive the integration. 

# Introduction

In the last few years unconventional energy (UE) production has been considered a significant potential economic resource for Australia. Unconventional energy in the Australian context, generally refers to gas held in shale or coal formations, along with what is known as "tight gas" [@Taylor2012, p.7]. 

As noted by Professor Martin in the Committee for Economic Development of Australia (CEDA) report, property rights and water management are key issues for unconventional energy production [@Taylor2012, p.5]. For water management specifically, Martin recommended that; 

* Water allocation and licensing frameworks needed to be enhanced to include water that is produced, and consumed by UE producers 
* Due to the potential for irreversible damage to environmental systems, including hydrological systems, UE producers develop a robust risk management framework with strong precautionary principles 

In investigating the requirements for such a framework, [@Maud2015] found gaps at three levels. Legislative, calculative, and technical. The aim of this article is to address the calculative gap. 

# Risk Management

Randall, suggested that the polar spectrum of risk management has the precautionary principle at one pole, and ordinary risk management (ORM) at the other, which Randall characterised as a systematic repression of innovation vs a continuing sequence of occasional disasters respectively [@Randall2012, p.157].

"ORM is built upon the paradigm case of well-specified games of chances in which outcome possibilities are known, as are their probabilities" [@Randall2012, p.158]. 
ORM aims to "defer risk-management intervention" & "unconvincing responses to the challenge of
low-probability, high-damage threats.""
[@Randall2012, p.158]. 

## Risk management tools
The toolkit for managing private risks may still be organised into Ehrlich and Becker’s classic
categories of market insurance, self-insurance and self-protection.7 

* Market insurance: individuals and firms buy insurance policies 
* Self-insurance: firm sets aside resources sufficient to survive losses
* Self-protection: measures that prevent or mitigate bad outcomes

"The distinction between ORM and precautionary approaches lies less in the risk management tools that may be invoked, but in the assessment of risk, the decision rules applied and the timing of intervention."" [@Randall2012, p.158]. 




The framework.. "it does not provide any guidance to operators, the community or
agencies in relation to when fracking ought not to occur due to the risks of
impacts on water resources being too great." [@Boudicca2013].

" levels of risk that are unacceptable and at which level, Hydraulic
Fracturing activities should not be approved. This includes areas where there
is: 1. high risk of significant changes to pressure or levels of groundwater or
surface water; 2. contamination of shallow and deep aquifers as a result of
induced interconnectivity or connection with existing fractures/faults; or 3.
intersection with existing wells and changed hydraulic pressures allowing
migration of hydraulic fracturing fluids, methane and geogenic agents out of
targeted coal seam gas beds into adjacent aquifers.[@Boudicca2013].


The requirements under current Hydraulic Fracturing Codes are premised on
the view that adaptive management or mitigation is an appropriate response to
the risks identified. The Alliance is concerned that this approach fails to provide
a process by which the actual risks are to be dealt with should the risk
management approach fail. The Alliance maintains that leading practice in
Hydraulic Fracturing regulation should include licence cancelation or
suspension in response to a breach of the best practice requirements under
the Code."

[@Boudicca2013].




# Risk & Reliability Assessment Methodologies and Language

In the established literature surrounding water and hydrosystems engineering it is common to find risk assessments centered around the concepts of *load* ($\mathit{l}$) and *resistance* ($\mathit{r}$) [@Goodarzi2013, @Mays2010]. ^[Mays notes that structural engineers might be more familiar with the concepts of *strength* and *stress* respectively.] 

Resistance is defined as the ability of a system component to meet it's designed purpose without failure when subjected to an external load. Load might be a mechanical or other forcing stress. The hydrosystems discussion is typically within the context of dams, and dam failure. 





In this context, reliability ($\mathit{R}$) is defined the probability of the resistance exceeding the load. It is the "measure of the degree to which a system ensures mission success by functioning properly over its intended life" [@NASA2007]. That is, the probability of survival [@Mays2010, p.387], defined mathematically as;

\[
  \mathit{R} = \mathit{P}( \mathit{r} > \mathit{l} ) = \mathit{P}( \mathit{r} - \mathit{l} > 0 ) 
\]

Risk ($\mathit{ \bar{R} }$) is then defined as the inverse of reliability. That is the probability of the load exceeding the resistance, or the probability of failure [Ibid], defined mathematically as; 
	
\[
  \mathit{\bar{R}} = 1 - \mathit{R}
\]

### Environmental Risk

The concepts of load and resistance as used in risk and reliability calculations were introduced above [@Goodarzi2013, @Mays2010]. Whilst Goodarzi et al applied these concepts in hydrosystems, they are not typically applied to ecology or biology. 
de Guenni [@deGuenni2012] introduce a quantitative definition of Environmental Risk 

\[

  \mathit{\bar{R}_{residual}} = \mathit{\bar{R}_{v}} \bullet \mathit{\bar{R}_{t}} \bullet \mathit{\bar{R}_{\neg CM}} 

\]

de Guenni then moves on to quantify the expected cost of loss (*ECL*). 

\[

  \mathit{ECL} = \mathit{\bar{R}_{final}} \bullet \mathit{C}_$
\]

Should there be a further integrate of the hydrosystems approach of using load and resistance with the environmetrics approach shown by de Guenni? 

Li, evaluated ecosystem risk with similar method, defining reliability of an  ecosystem as the probability of the water resources of the
oasis to yield a supply greater than the need. We denote it
by the equation as follows:

\[
  \mathit{R} = \mathit{P}(\mathit{X}_t)
\]

 however not using the language of load and resistance [@LI2007]. 


#### Environmental Resistance

An integration of traditional hydrosystems/water engineering risk analysis methods with environmental methods might be achieved by applying the concepts of load and resistance in biology & ecology. Whether 



Chapman represented the environment as resistance to "biotic potential", measured as the difference between potential organism population - "biotic potential" - and actual population [@Chapman1931, p.194].

Chapman noted that this approach was analogous to the methods of Fourier and Ohm with the resistances of 1) heat transmission through a solid and 2) electric current transmission through a system respectively [Ibid.]. Chapman suggested a generalisation of Ohm's law from electrical circuits could applied applicable in ecology, where resistance is defined as the resistance offered to an unvarying current by a standard-unit circuit [Ibid.]. 

If the Chapman's uses of load and resistance might be

One novel linkage is through the concept of environmental (or ecological) resistance. Ecologists and biologists have  



## Bridging the gap and creating another

As noted above, qualitative risk assessments like that done for Spring Connectivity in the UWIR, have difficulty of reproducibility, and typically do not lead to a quantified consequence in dollar terms. The question about whether or not there is effort required to bridge this gap, or whether or not the qualitative risk assessment is adequate.

In terms of the argument for a closer integration, as was also noted above, if there is no connection between the ecosystems dependent on a bore and the risk of any event associated with a bore, then the *de facto* make good risk is pegged to the bore license value for UTC calculations. Hence, the ecosystem value of the bore does not enter the risk calculation.

What is required is the 



The recent concept of ecosystems services, has come some way to address this gap.  


"The embodied energy of the environmental system, such as marsh
(storage and annual flow), is the basis for attracting economic
activity, which is competitive so long as the ratio of free embodied
energy embodied in purchased inputs (goods, services, fuels) is
greater than that of competitors"





In the case of ecology, one approach originally suggested by systems ecologist H.T.Odum [^1] was to put a dollar value on ecosystem services [@Odum1971, @Odum1979a, @Odum1981, @Odum1987, @Odum1994, @Odum1995, @Odum2000]. As Lansing notes [-@Lansing1998], this was a controversial attempt to create a common framework for ecology - broadly understood to include hydrological circuits - and economics within the field of thermodynamics and analog electric circuits. 

Whilst the analogical method was well established in rocket science and engineering [@Olson1958, @Cohen1963, @Fifer1961, @Norris1966, @Phillips1969, @Sinkoff, @Stallman1963, @Tomayko1985, @Truitt1960, @Walton1963, @West1957], it was argued by Taylor and others that the same method was not appropriate for large scale systems such as economic and ecological systems [@Taylor1988, @Taylor1991].

Perhaps due to this continuing controversy surrounding Odum's work, the approach has not been applied in any meaningful way in risk analysis. However there are linkages which can be retrieved from the literature.






[^1]: 
  Interestingly, Odum was apparently shocked that tar sands and shale gas were touted as energetically viable replacements for conventional energy resources. "Exploiting profit-positive but negative net-energy deposits, burns energy, destroys the boreal ecosystems, drains aquifers, and increases global heating. My father never believed that we would be so stupid." [M.Odum, cited in @Weyler2011].

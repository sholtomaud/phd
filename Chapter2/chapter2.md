# Abstract

The water industry has a long history with respects storing data, computing and modelling flows for various purposes, including flood forecasting, and engineering. Legacy systems have been developed over many years to accommodate these computing requirements. Unconventional Energy Production like Coal Seam Gas or Shale Gas, are relatively new fields which present novel and complex scenarios in terms of the data required for effectively monitoring the compliacne and technical risks. Included in these risks are impacts on both Environmental and Hydrological systems. Unconventional Energy Production therefore has presented a new set of requirements at the interface of energy, water and environment, where many of the legacy data systems are unable to accomodated the new set of requirements in terms of data models and flexibility.Presented in this article is a review of legacy data systems together with a method and technology, designed to be able to accomodate the diverse demands for more complex requirements of UEP.

# Introduction

Hydrology, and, to a lesser degree, Environmental/Ecological Science, are old sciences which have developed hand in hand with both engineering, and in the last century, computing technology [@fleming_computer_1975]. Hydrology in particular has been used to form conceptual analogies when teaching other sciences like electronics (hydraulic analogy references) [@Bokulich] and economics (the analog water economy reference). 

The use of analogy has been two-way, a back and forth between the sciences each forming the other in a kind of dialectic-duplex. Hydrology has been used to clarify and convey electric concepts [REF], and electric concepts have been used to model hydrological [@fleming_computer_1975] and ecological sytsems [@odum_use_1962, @odum_electrical_1965, @odum_ecological_1994]. As the back and forth between the domains has progressed so have the sciences and engineering practice, each forming the other. 


In industrial practice - 
Unconventional Energy Production (UEP) has become a nexus point of science & engineering integration for hydrology, environment, energy health and safety. Operations for extrating natural gas from Coal Seams also typically involves the extration of groundwater from aquifers, with the potenial impact on local and surrounding ecosystems.

But whilst UEP interfaces with the three systems of ecosystems, hydrology and energy recourses, and whislt there have been attemps to define the dynamics and statis of ecologial, socio-economic and hydrological sciences in terms of energy laws [@odum_energy_1981, @odum_environment_1971], this level of conceptual integration has not been required for UEP operations. Casting doubt over the  

Rather, at an operational level UEP has required the integration of specialist software applications and their diverse data models which have been developed in the resource domains of Energy, Hydrology and Environmental scienece, together with the human domains of health and safety, finance, human resources and the like.

# The Evolution of Data Models

Data Models are X . Data Models are often expressed through database schemas, and these in turn are commonly relational in design. Data Models are typically developed to accomodate data requiements that are specific to a particular domain. THere are ofcourse many domains, but there is no generic domain, as a result there is no one-size-fits-all data model which can be used to .


Evolution of data consciousness.

1. Requirement to capture data
2. Spreadsheets in definition of data model & types of analysis
3. Spreadsheets fail & need a database and administrator
4. Quality of the data stored in the database

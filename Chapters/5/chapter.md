# Abstract

Defined as a horizontal self-regulating structure and processes for collective decision-making involving government and non-government actors with the aim of producing collectively binding decisions without superior authority, the scope of Risk Governance is interdisciplinary, covering topics such as the environment, finance, public and corporate health and safety, legacy and emerging technologies. A novel cloud-based BigData approach to risk governance was developed with the intent of affording data visualisation and reporting for diverse stakeholder requirements in the Unconventional Energy and Groundwater industries. The technical solution incorporated a hybrid system with NoSQL, schema-less technology at the back-end, and JSONSchemas at the front end to emulate legacy systems. This article reports on the experience of developing such technology, the pros and cons, and overall ability to meet stakeholder requirements.

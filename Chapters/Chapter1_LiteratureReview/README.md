# Literature Review

## Introduction

In the last few years unconverntional energy (UE) production has been considered a significant potential economic resource for Australia. Unconventional energy in the Australian context, generally refers to gas held in shale or coal formations, along with what is known as "tight gas" {{Ref CEDA 2012 p.7}}. 

As noted by Professor Martin {{Ref CEDA 2012 p.5}} in the Committee for Economic Development of Australia (CEDA) report, property rights and water management are key issues for unconventional energy production. For water management specifically, Martin recommended that; 

* Water allocation and licensing frameworks needed to be enhanced to include water that is produced, and consumed by UE producers {{Ibid.}} 
* Due to the potential for irreversible damage to environmental systems, including hydrological systems, UE producers develop a robust risk management framework with strong precautionary principles 

Within the latter of these two concepts, Taylor recommended that UE users of water resources should carry the costs associated with any impacts of energy production activities, and that precautionary measures be scaled according to information available about impacts {{CEDA 2012, p.11}}. 

The notion of scaling precautionary or corrective (so-called "make good") actions in response to information is encompassed in the concept of Adaptive Environmental Management (AEM), and the associated Groundwater Model Multi Criteria Analysis (GMMCA). Both of these concepts aim to enable regulatory flexibility, and to refine and improve risk mapping over time. {{Beckers et al 2013 - Beckers, Jos, Troy Cook, and Adam Butcher. “Groundwater Risks Associated with Coal Seam Gas Development in the Surat and Southern Bowen Basins - Final Report.” WorleyParsons Resource and Energy, 2013.
}}. 



As a part of this flexibility, Beckers et al recommend that adaptive methodologies include the temporal aspect within risk assessment (2013, p.iii), with the ability to track long term effects. This type of recommendation implies a long term monitoring effort with associated hydrology data storage technologies for meta-data, and timeseries data.

## Conclusions

This review has focuses on the regulatory frameworks which have been concieved to provide effective management of the risks associated with Unconventional Energy production.


It is suggested that a proof of concept be undertaken, exploring a technical framework by which the temporal component can be integrated into precautionary measures, which are either relaxed or enhanced in response.

Along with integrating model uncertainty into the calculation of risk.


The concept introduced within this technical framework is that of DYNAMIC RISK. Risk which changes over time. The concept of Dynamic Risk acknowledges that the components that go to makeup a risk calcualtion themselves change over time, which in turn makes risk a timeseries. 

As is elaborated in Chapter 2 of this work, included within dynamic risk calculations are consequence (measured in Dollars), probability, and uncertainty. Each of these can change as more or less information becomes available, or as other factors vary, such as changes in licensing values and allocations in response to prevailing climate conditions, such as a drought for example.

Coal Seam CSG exploration and production (hereafter, CSG operations) raise community concern due to the potential impacts on long-term food security, water resources, public health and individual property rights for the sake of mining royalties, economic growth and employment opportunities


## What is Risk?

Risk is the product of probability and consequence



## Types of Risk

Identified below are many different types of risk associated with different disciplines and contexts.

* Static vs Dynamic -> asset changing risk status over time
* Risk Intensity/Density -> analogy which might be used to incorporate uncertainty
* Technical/Operational
* Compliance/Legal
* Bus Factor
* Political/social -> social license
* Strategic 
* Financial
* Model Risk
* Environmental/Health & Safety
* Data Quality Risk
* Reliability Engineering

* Can we have one size fits all for a generic methodology?
* Do we need to select each risk method according to the scenario/context?

## Uncertainty and risk

1. How do we feed the uncertainty of our data into the associate risks
2. Are there different types of risk that need to be evaluated differently and fed into the risk calculation differently?
3. Is the typical risk matrix appropriate for all circumstances?
4. Should uncertainty only just accompany the risk as a second value?

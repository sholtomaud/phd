## Risk management frameworks

In the Terms of Reference for Activity 5 of the CSG Feasibility Study, a hybrid Groundwater Model and Multi Criteria Analysis (GMMCA) risk assessment methodology was developed [@Beckers2013].

## What is a risk management framework?

## Frameworks

Randall [-@Randall2012], called for an integrated framework which integrates both precautionary and OSM methods in what he calls STS - screening, pre-release testing, and post-release surveillance. The figure directly below is Randall's diagram depicting this process.

![Randall's STS](./images/Randall-STS.PNG)



If Randall's diagram is turned on it's side it resembles the V-model introduced by Rook for software project engineering [@Rook1986]. Rook's concept (see figure below) was subsequently adopted by the Systems Engineering community [@Mooz1997, @Mooz2001, @Estefan2007].

![Standard V-model](./images/Rook1986.PNG)

If we consider Randall's diagram of STS  analogous to the V-model used in Systems Engineering the it would be fortunate and perhaps assuring that legislative theory had produced a similar procedure as the well-established methods of Systems Engineering. Moreover Randall's analysis might gain more value from further considersideration.

The figure below shows a standard V-model. In the System's Engineering terminology, pre-release would be roughly equivalent to pre-implementation, the left arm of the 'V'. Screening equal to the requirements gathering and design phase of the left arm of the 'V'.. Post-release surveillance is post-implementation operations and maintenance in the right arm of the 'V'.

![Standard V-model](./images/V-model.png)

The notable difference between the Systems Engineering method and Randall's STS method is the intended realm of application. STS is aimed at a higher level of societal governance rather than a project mission execution. If the V-model from Systems Engineering were enhanced to be used as a governance tool, one might introduce a prohibition arrow in the pre-implementation phase. The figure below depicts this enhancement.

![V-governance Prohibition Model](./images/V-govern.png)

In placing prohibition on the left-arm of the 'V', we might also consider the governance aspect of the right-arm of the 'V' - what happens if the management systems fail? As noted above, the system is operating in a civil context, where the main reparations are conducted under MGM's. Hence we can extend the simple V-model further to depict the reparations required for civilians when operations go wrong as shown in the figure below.

![V-governance Make Good Model](./images/V-mg.png)

In order for the framework to achieve these goals, it is important that it provides
comprehensive references to the scientific information and data framework it intends on
using, or indeed any scientific information it has consulted. Demonstrable scientific
underpinning will assist in community and industry education, and improvement in
developing and implementing leading practices [@Hunter2013]. 

practical steps to measure, share and analyse environmental data across
jurisdictions [@ANEDO2013]. 



As noted in the Harmonisation Framework, QLD applies an adaptive management approach. In this approach, defined trigger thresholds are used to initiate the make-good process [@SCER2013, p.47]. 


## Strict Liability

With reference to the two recommendations made above, Taylor [Ibid] went on to suggest that where UE producers use water resources, they should carry the costs associated with any impacts from activities. This view concurs with the views of landholders, who wish to receive appropriate compensation and payments [@VFF2013, ]. 

Strict liability is the imposition of liability on a party without a finding of fault. The question is whether UE producers have  would therefore be afforded to the tortfeasor. 

In this context the NWC recommended that bonds and sureties should deal with uncertainty and the timeframes associated with potential impacts [@NWC2010]. As the NWC noted, these time frames may potentially extend past 100 years, which is well-beyond the expected life-span of the CSG recovery process.

"This includes impacts such as long-term reductions in adjacent aquifer pressures and levels, and impacts on environmental assets that are not adequately protected by current ‘make good’ mechanisms" [@NWC2010].

"risk assessment model must include a definition of ‘unacceptable impacts’ to the environment and human health and any projects falling in this category should not be allowed to proceed. Risk assessment should not be undertaken by the proponent but by an independent third party."  ... “Verification of key system elements” should not rely on appraisal by “in house
representatives” but rather only “independent third-party professional[s]”. [@Boudicca2013]

## Connection between Risk, Liability and Make Good

"At the project level, the cumulative effects of many wells across the landscape will challenge the
feasibility of making good. Another challenge arises because the impacts on aquifers are likely to play
out on a time-scale of many decades and perhaps centuries, whereas the time-scale of CSG extraction
is shorter."



"At the basin level, which really matters in the CSG case where so much of the action will impact the GAB, the cumulative impacts over several centuries are (I would argue) near-impossible to predict."
 [@Randall2012, p.154]. 

This introduces both cumulative impacts, and uncertainty into the risk assessment.

### Cumulative Effects

As noted by the National Water Comission (NWC), in the context of groundwater, these costs may have the potential to persist beyond the life cycle of the UE production.

This raises concern over the temporal extent of liability. The tort "civil wrong". The term "cumulative effect" is used to conceptualise this temporal extent of liability. 

Cumulative effects are effects that are successive or incremental over time [@Howe2010]. Whilst Taylor's discussion was framed within the context of negative effects, the concept of cumulative effect was designed not to have pejorative content, but to recognise that cumulative effects on society, the economy and the environment can be conceived as either positive or negative, or a combination of the two at any one time. 

In a legal context, this raises the question of whether such cumulative effects are held as unavoidable, or whether liability is *res ipsa loquitur*: That is, where negligence is attributed by the evidence of cumulative impact, rather than by breach of duty [@Schremmer2011]. 

The resolution of this question has legal consequence in the calculation of risk, and in the perceived risk, since the granting the status of unavoidable, would appear to reduce liability claims by the plaintiff, and the associated risk of the operation. 

The notion of scaling precautionary, or corrective (so-called "make good") actions in response to information is encompassed in the concept of Adaptive Environmental Management (AEM). In the context of groundwater a Groundwater Model Multi Criteria Analysis (GMMCA) was proposed as an enhanced a Multi Criteria Analysis (MCA) designed to incorporate geological, hydrological, environmental and economic attributes within the AEM paradigm [@Beckers2013]. Both the GMMCA, and the concept of scaling precaution have the intent to enable regulatory flexibility, and to refine and improve risk mapping over time [@Beckers2013]. 

For Taylor precautionary measures be scaled according to information available about impacts [@Taylor2012, p.11]. As a part of this flexibility, Beckers et al recommend that adaptive methodologies include the temporal aspect within risk assessment [@Beckers2013, p.iii], with the ability to track long term effects. This type of recommendation implies a long term monitoring effort with associated hydrology data storage technologies for meta-data, and timeseries data. And in addition to these usual types of data, the temportal aspect of risk should also thereofre be stored. 

The attempt to integrate these enhancements in Australia has highlighted legislative and technical gaps. It is the intention of this review to document some of these gaps as noted in the literature, and within the technical community. Finally, potential solutions are proposed as a goals for future research with specific interest in the visualisation of risk as a management tool.

## Proposed Legislative Enhancements

## Risk Management 

The Purple Book [@Stoffen2005]

Risk management broadly considered consists of risk identification and analysis, evaluation and control [@Baker1998]. Randall has suggested that the spectrum of risk management strategies has the precautionary principle at one pole, and ordinary risk management (ORM) at the other. This spectrum might be characterised as a risk-control trade off [@Manjón2004], where the precautionary strategy maximizes control by minimizing risk with a potential repression of innovation, and the ORM strategy maximizes utility by accepting increased risk of failure, or even a continuing sequence of disasters [@Randall2012, p.157].

"The distinction between ORM and precautionary approaches lies less in the risk management tools that may be invoked, but in the assessment of risk, the decision rules applied and the timing of intervention."" [@Randall2012, p.158]. 

Model uncertainty and "unknown unknowns" provides a difficulty to OSM, which as Randall states, ".. is built upon the paradigm case of well-specified games of chances in which outcome possibilities are known, as are their probabilities" [@Randall2012, p.158]. When probabilities are not known due to uncertainty, then the precautionary approach appears to win.

An incremental where we start with the precautionary at the top of the V and then descending down the left arm is the prohibition arm.  The deployment arm is the monitoring and verification arm. Once the system is in this phase, any failure will generate an impact which will need a risk management tool to come into effect, with the associated costs.

ORM aims to "defer risk-management intervention" & "unconvincing responses to the challenge of
low-probability, high-damage threats.""
[@Randall2012, p.158]. 

## Risk management tools
The toolkit for managing private risks may still be organised into Ehrlich and Becker’s classic
categories of market insurance, self-insurance and self-protection.7 

* Market insurance: individuals and firms buy insurance policies 
* Self-insurance: firm sets aside resources sufficient to survive losses
* Self-protection: measures that prevent or mitigate bad outcomes

Make Good is one of the risk management tools. However it is not 

The risks cited in the literature are tabulated below:

|#|Asset at Risk | Hazard | Source | Reference |
|:----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|1.|Aquifer |Disturbance and irreparable damage| Construction |[@Randall2012, p.155]|

#### Make Good Agreements (MGA) and Make Good Measures (MGM)

"A make good agreement is an arrangement between a tenure holder and water bore owner" [@EHP2013, p.2]. Make good measures applies if the relevant authority believes that a bore is impaired. A make good measure is the measure a petroleum tenure holder will take if a bore has an impaired capacity. [@EHP2013, p.2]. An impairment will (should) be documents in a bore report, and can be when a bore no longer supplies a reasonable quantity or quality of water for its authorised use or purpose, with the ultimate arbiter being the governing chief executive [@QSG].

But what should the make-good measure be? As noted by Randall [-@Randall2012], MGMs were intended as *in-kind* reparations for any impacts. EHP suggested these measures could include works on a bore, such as deepening, where the costs of works are borne by the petroleum tenure holder (PTH) [@EHP2013]. Or, alternately, the PTH may provide the water bore owner monetary compensation as the MGM. 

#### Make Good Risk in Unit Technical Cost

For landholders and the PTH, the dollar consequence of any impairment to a bore is quantified in the MGM. Hence the risk, in this instance is the probability of the impairment, and the MGM dollar cost: 

If the symbol for risk is $$ \mathit{\bar{R}} $$, we will symbolise Make Good Risk with a subscript $$ \mathit{\bar{R}_{MG}} $$ 

Probability of Impairment is $$ \mathit{P}_{I} $$ 

Dollar Consequence, or Cost of Make Good Measure is $$ \mathit{C}_{MGM} $$  

Then:

$$ \mathit{R}_{MG} = \mathit{P}(\mathit{I}) \bullet \mathit{C}_{MGM} $$

For simplicity sake, when calculating the Unit Technical Cost (UTC) of operations, C_MGM is set to the dollar value of the groundwater bore license. MGM works on the bore may exceed the license value in some cases, however some impairments are difficult to predict *a priori*, and so the bore license value assumes *de facto* liability for UTC calculations. 

#### Make Good Reliability

Having derived the simple math above, we might also explore the inverse of make good risk ( $$ \mathit{\bar{R}_{MG}} })

$$ \mathit{\bar{R}_{MG}} = 1 - \mathit{R}_{MG} $$ 

This means that Make Good Risk is the inverse of Make Good Reliability. 

# Risk and Liability

There are gaps in the approaches above, the main issue in arriving at a unified risk framework appears to be: 
The gap identified by the literature appears to be the connection between GMMCA risk assessment and the make good measures. 

Whilst they have their place as a behavioral heuristic in the enforcement of safety procedures, the qualitative risk assessment methodology, with risk levels assigned through expert opinion, does not typically have a dollar value attached. This makes NPV and PV estimations of financial liability difficult to quantify. 






  

In the calculation above, Make Good Risk (R_MG) has a dollar value attached. In the case of repair works, the cost of MGM's can only truly be known *ex post facto*, for example, after an invoice has been received. -- [Footnote] To the knowledge of the author, there is no provision in the Harmonised Risk Management Framework (HRMF) for the recovery of data on MGM costs. This makes *post hoc* analysis a difficult task.-- However most stakeholders are not interested in *post hoc* analysis, but rather, the *ex ante* liability, the liability before the event to calculate ROI, and determine resource economics. 

This is especially the case for a PTH in the calculation of UTC, which typically includes decommissioning costs, and, in the case of CSG, any MGM costs. The default case mentioned above, of assigning C_MGM to the bore license value is one way of quantifying *ex ante* liability. Whether or not the license value has parity with MGM costs is moot, until such time as an MGM is fully executed. 

Pegging Make Good Risk to the bore license value transfers the burden of consequence calculation to the license issuer.

(b) carrying out a plan to monitor the bore, including, for example, by undertaking periodic bore assessments;
(c) giving the bore owner monetary or non-monetary compensation for the bore's impaired capacity.

## Technical Context

The prevailing Technical Context (TC) might be characterised by three different approaches to the task of providing a data system capable of meeting the requirements of risk management.

``` 
1. in-house technical  
2. out-sourced vendor  
3. hybrid 

```

In #3, the hybrid situation, the data system is typically maintained by a team of subject experts together with a system administrator.


Whilst there are many data software applications currently available within the industry (Aquarius is one), typically at a State Government level the Hydstra(TM) data system developed and maintained by Kisters Pty Ltd, is the defacto standard for rainfall and stream level data. Some States or Local Government entities use different software systems, however Hydstra is predominantly the main system.  

Hydstra is also used at the national level within the BoM, however two other systems are also used; the in-house AWRIS2 developed as apart of the hydrographic modernisation project, and the WISKI(TM) system manufactured by the European branch of Kisters (Kisters AGM). 

The situation is a little more diverse when it comes to Groundwater and Water Quality. There are several systems such as Equis, EnviroSys, HydSys, and in Queensland there is the well-known Ground Water Database (GWDB) developed and maintainted in-house within the QLD NRM. An inventory of all the known systems is available below.

## Conclusions and Future Work

This review has focuses on the regulatory frameworks which have been concieved to provide effective management of the risks associated with Unconventional Energy production.

The design intent of the legislative concepts appears to necessitate a technical legislative framework to store and integrate many different dtata types over time. Such a framework is the main interest for future work. The three novel technical goals of that work envisiaged are; 

1. Proof of concept for a technical framework, which enables;
2. The integration of the temporal component of risk into precautionary and adaptive measures, and
3. The integration of model uncertainty into the calculation of risk.

## What is Risk?

Risk is the product of probability and consequence

The national water commission identified the following potential risks to sustainable water management:

Extracting large volumes of low-quality water will impact on connected surface and
groundwater systems, some of which may already be fully or overallocated, including the
Great Artesian Basin and Murray-Darling Basin.
Impacts on other water users and the environment may occur due to the dramatic
depressurisation of the coal seam, including:
o changes in pressures of adjacent aquifers with consequential changes in water
availability
o reductions in surface water flows in connected systems
o land subsidence over large areas, affecting surface water systems, ecosystems,
irrigation and grazing lands.
The production of large volumes of treated waste water, if released to surface water
systems, could alter natural flow patterns and have significant impacts on water quality, and
river and wetland health. There is an associated risk that, if the water is overly treated, ‘clean
water’ pollution of naturally turbid systems may occur.
The practice of hydraulic fracturing, or fraccing, to increase gas output, has the potential to
induce connection and cross-contamination between aquifers, with impacts on groundwater
quality.
The reinjection of treated waste water into other aquifers has the potential to change the
beneficial use characteristics of those aquifers. 
[@NWC2010]

## Uncertainty and risk

1. How do we feed the uncertainty of our data into the associate risks
2. Are there different types of risk that need to be evaluated differently and fed into the risk calculation differently?
3. Is the typical risk matrix appropriate for all circumstances?
4. Should uncertainty only just accompany the risk as a second value?

"Uncertainty expresses the degree of belief analysts have
in their estimates. Uncertainty decreases as the quality of
data and understanding of the system improve. The initial estimates of failure rates or failure probability might
be based on comparison to similar equipment, historical
data (heritage), failure rate data from handbooks, or expert elicitation." [@NASA2007]

"Reliability estimates express probability of success.
 Uncertainty should be included with reliability estimates.
 Reliability estimates combined with FMEAs provide
additional and valuable information to aid in the decisionmaking
process" [@NASA2007]

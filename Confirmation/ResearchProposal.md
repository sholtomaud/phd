# Research Proposal

## RESEARCH QUESTION

Can we use big data and data-driven interfaces to leverage global risk governance requirements for water and unconventional energy production at reduced cost?

## AIMS AND OBJECTIVES

The thesis is at the highest level an investigation into both system engineering and system design to accommodate the objective of integrating multiple data models for the purpose of risk governance in the unconventional energy industry.

The aims within this objective is to enable web services for risk governance portfolio for stakeholders. The types of risk under interest are: cumulative, ecoservices, compliance, financial with the potential for expansion. Within the goals the aims are to generate: 

* Geopoint services acquiring data from legacy systems
* Data models meta-translation service for schema integration
* Risk acquisition & attribution through forms & calculation services, turning risk into a timeseries
* Global risk governance portfolio
* 2D maps for proof of concept demonstration
* Reporting and visualisation

## RESEARCH PLAN

As an investigation into both system engineering and design the research plan will cover both regulatory and information topics and practical tasks of development. Theoretical topics include Risk Assessment and how Assessment relates to Risk Governance in the unconventional energy industry. Practical tasks will involve coding and deployment of Minimum Viable Products. The main methods used in the practical aspect of the plan will be kind of reactive development. 

These topics and tasks will be the subject of 5 articles and one literature review, each of which will comprise a chapter in the overall Thesis. The specific chapter headings and content may be subject to change, but proposed headings, and article titles are designated with an asterisk below:

## RESOURCES, SKILLS & PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT

The following skills will be required for the successful completion of the project. They will be acquired through consulting, and attending industry seminars and workshops.

* NoSQL
* Understanding of Effective Risk Governance Model
* Big Data Systems
* Data analysis 
* Node.js
* Data-driven interfaces
* DevOps

## BARRIERS TO SUCCESS

The main barriers to success will be skill & system development within the timelines of the research. Developing techniques for handling non-standardised data formats are significant challenges. Engagement of Government agencies that are the source of data model variabilities will also provide a challenge as many organisation have a high level of conservativeness with respects to Information Systems. 

To manage these barriers, technical expertise will be developed during the course of the project to accommodated any skill gaps. Industry will also be engaged in a minimal impact way so that there is no significant imposition on government and industry resources throughout the life of the project.

## CONTRIBUTIONS TO KNOWLEDGE

The project will contribute further understanding around 

* Applicability of unstructured persistence to interoperability problem, and whether such can be viable
* Applicability of data-driven interfaces to the regulation forms, and whether regulators will have a new technology to enable effective regulation
* The cost associated with development of such technologies
* The resource efficiencies that might be obtained in the use of such technologies.

  abstract = {UML, the Universal Modeling Language, was the first language designed to fulfill the requirement for "universality." However, it is a software-specific language, and does not support the needs of engineers designing from the broader systems-based perspective. Therefore, SysML was created. It has been steadily gaining popularity, and many companies, especially in the heavily-regulated Defense, Automotive, Aerospace, Medical Device and Telecomms industries, are already using SysML, or are plannning to switch over to it in the near future. However, little information is currently available on the market regarding SysML. Its use is just on the crest of becoming a widespread phenomenon, and so thousands of software engineers are now beginning to look for training and resources. The proposed book will provide an introduction to SysML, and instruction on how to implement it, for all these new users. *The first available book on SysML in English *Insider information! The author is a member of the SysML working group and has written sections of the specification *Special focus comparing SysML and UML, and explaining how both can work together},

  abstract = {Much of the convenience of modern life resides in sheet metal, the cowling shield of most machines and appliances. However, the load that this takes off human shoulders has to be carried elsewhere, and the Earth has borne the burden. Many of us woke up to the environmental cost when over a century of industrialization finally surpassed the capacity of nature to assimilate it. International in scope, Heavy Metals in the Environment: Using Wetlands for Their Removal discusses wetland functions and heavy metal contamination. It addresses such questions as: Can systems powered by sunlight handle toxins more effectively than systems running on fossil fuel? At what scale and by what means do we define efficiency? These questions resonate increasingly with a number of global challenges. As inescapable as climate change, you can no longer avoid airborne toxins, acid rain, and polluted water by moving away from them. When the time comes to rely less on fossil fuel-based technology, how will we clean up the aftermath of toxic misadventures? Written by a leader in the growing field of ecological engineering, Heavy Metals in the Environment: Using Wetlands for Their Removal presents scientific studies that illustrate how natural systems use wetlands to adapt to changes in the ecosystem. It focuses primarily on lead, one of the first materials used by developing civilizations and a metal used heavily in the industrial era. The goal: to achieve a better understanding of how natural systems use wetlands to adapt to wastes.},

  abstract = {It is well established that high levels of unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) can be toxic to the central nervous system, and oxidative stress is emerging as a relevant event in the mechanisms of UCB encephalopathy. In contrast, the hydrophilic bile acid, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), has been reported as a cytoprotective and antioxidant molecule. In this study, we investigated if exposure of rat neurons in primary culture to clinically relevant concentrations of UCB leads to oxidative injury. The contribution of oxidative stress in UCB neurotoxicity was further investigated by examining whether the reduction of NO production by NAME, an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, prevents the disruption of the redox status and neuronal damage. Moreover, we evaluated the ability of glycoursodeoxycholic acid (GUDCA), the most relevant conjugated derivative in the serum of patients treated with UDCA, to abrogate the UCB-induced oxidative damage. Cultured rat neurons were incubated with 50 or 100 \ensuremath{\mu}M UCB in the presence of 100 \ensuremath{\mu}M human serum albumin, alone or in combination with 100 \ensuremath{\mu}M NAME or with 50 \ensuremath{\mu}M GUDCA, for 4 h at 37 {\textdegree}C. Protein carbonyls, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal-protein adducts, intracellular glutathione content and cell death were determined. The results obtained showed that UCB induces protein oxidation and lipid peroxidation, while diminishes the thiol antioxidant defences, events that were correlated with the extent of cell death. Moreover, these events were counteracted by NAME and abrogated in the presence of GUDCA. Collectively, this study shows that oxidative stress is one of the pathways associated with neuronal viability impairment by UCB, and that GUDCA significantly prevents such effects from occurring. These findings corroborate the antioxidant properties of the bile acid and point to a new therapeutic approach for UCB-induced neurotoxicity due to oxidative stress.

Crop production and transformation processes have been investigated by the traditional energy and carbon analyses and the more recent emergy analysis.

The combination of such analyses provides a deeper insight into the problems of converting biomass to fuel. In particular it is shown that emergy analysis can evaluate long-term sustainability and comparisons of emergy-based indices can be used to compare efficiency and environmental input between various production systems.},

  abstract = {The goal of this work is to provide a multi-method multi-scale comparative picture of selected terrestrial transport modalities. This is achieved by investigating the Italian transportation system by means of four different evaluation methods: material flow accounting (MFA), embodied energy analysis (EEA), exergy analysis (EXA) and emergy synthesis (ES). The case study is the main Italian transportation infrastructure, composed by highways, railways, and high-speed railways (high-speed trains, HST) sub-systems supporting both passengers and freight transport. All the analyses have been performed based on a common database of material, labor, energy and fuel input flows used in the construction, maintenance and yearly use of roads, railways and vehicles. Specific matter and energy intensities of both passenger and freight transportation services were calculated factors affecting results as well as strength and weakness points of each transportation modality were also stressed. Results pointed out that the most important factors in determining the acceptability of a transportation system are not only the specific fuel consumption and the energy and material costs of vehicles, as it is common belief, but also the energy and material costs for infrastructure construction as well as its intensity of use (with special focus on load factor of vehicles). The latter become the dominant factors in HST modality, due to technological and safety reasons that require high energy-cost materials and low intensity of traffic. This translates into very high thermodynamic and environmental costs for passenger and freight transported, among which an embodied energy demand up to 1.44�MJ/p-km and 3.09�MJ/t-km, respectively.},

  abstract = {In a previous paper the authors argued that the line dividing the �real world� from the �systems thinking world� in Soft Systems Methodology (SSM) should be disregarded lest it be taken to indicate a false dualism. One of the supporting reasons for the elimination of this line was the problem that arose in practice concerning the link between root definitions and conceptual models, constantly encountered during the 25 years in which SSM has been used and developed. The relationship between root definitions and conceptual models was taken to be based only on an instrumental �logic�. Here it is argued that root definitions define and induce dispositions. The dispositions root definitions define are expressed in terms of conceptual models, while the dispositions they induce are the source of the effects they have on the problem-solving practice. In this way, the sole dependency on instrumental logic as the link between the two is loosened, allowing different forms of relationship between the two to emerge, including ones linked more closely to the evolving content of a systems study. � 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Natural systems make their natural capital and ecosystem services available to human economy. A careful analysis of the interplay between natural and human-made capital is needed to prevent natural capital being overexploited for present economic benefits, affecting lifestyles and wellbeing of future generations. In this study, the emergy synthesis is used to evaluate the natural and the human-made capital of Campania region (southern Italy) by accounting for the environmental support directly and indirectly provided by nature to resource generation. Furthermore, geographic information system (GIS) models are integrated with the emergy accounting procedure to generate maps of the spatial patterns of both natural and human-made capital distribution. Regional storages of natural and human-made capital are identified and evaluated in emergy units (seJ). The human-made capital of the Campania region (6.29E + 24 seJ) results to be about 11 times higher than the natural capital (5.69E + 23 seJ) due to the past and present exploitation of the natural resources needed to generate it over time.

Moreover, by overlaying the total natural capital map and the total human-made capital map with a map of the protected areas within the region, only the 19\% of the regional natural capital appears to be concentrated within protected areas, while most of it (81\%) is concentrated outside. These findings suggest that the conservation of natural resources is also necessary outside protected areas by means of suitable policies, directives and investments. The human-made capital is mainly concentrated (88\%) inside non-protected areas and interacts with the local natural capital. A management of the interactions between the two categories of wealth is crucial to prevent that the growth of human-made storages degrades the natural ecosystems and the environment. The proposed emergy{\textendash}GIS framework reveals to be a useful tool for environmental planning and resource management aimed to conserve and protect the regional environmental heritage.},

  abstract = {This dissertation is comprised of an introduction and five manuscripts split into two main sections: theory and application. Manuscripts one and four have been published, manuscript three has been accepted for publication, and manuscripts two and five are currently in review for publication. The   theory  sections contains the first two manuscripts.                 The first manuscript is a review of the literature on Energy Return on Investment (EROI) analysis. I cover five areas in this manuscript, including: (1) EROI and corn ethanol, (2) EROI for most major fuels, (3) alternative EROI applications, (4) EROI and the economy, and (5) the minimum EROI for society.                 The second manuscript provides a methodological framework for performing EROI analysis. I cover the following areas in this manuscript: (1) boundaries of analysis, (2) energy quality corrections, (3) energy intensity values, and lastly (4) alternative EROI statistics.                 The applications  section contains manuscripts three through five. The third manuscript provides a biophysical model of economic growth indicating that the feedback mechanisms between oil supply and oil price have created a growth paradox: maintaining business as usual economic growth will require the production of new sources of oil, yet the only sources of oil remaining require high oil prices, thus hampering economic growth.                 The fourth manuscript is a study on the geographic variability of corn ethanol production. The main conclusions of this study were: (1) the statistical error associated with calculating the EROI of corn ethanol was enough to cast doubt as to whether corn ethanol yields net energy, and (2) failure to account for the geographic variation in corn yields and fertilizer inputs artificially inflated previous estimates of the EROI or corn ethanol.                 In the fifth manuscript I measure the impact of the Urban Heat Island within the metropolitan area of San Juan, Puerto Rico, on the electricity demand within the city. I calculated that the UHI within the San Juan area accounts for about four percent of the electricity demand every day, which accumulates to roughly 2.2 million dollars a month or 26 million dollars a year in electricity charges.

  abstract = {Rapid global expansion of unconventional natural gas development (UNGD) raises environmental health concerns. Many studies present information on these concerns, yet the strength of epidemiological evidence remains tenuous. This paper is a review of the strength of evidence in scientific reporting of environmental hazards from UNGD activities associated with adverse human health outcomes. Studies were drawn from peer-reviewed and grey literature following a systematic search. Five databases were searched for studies published from January 1995 through March 2014 using key search terms relevant to environmental health. Studies were screened, ranked and then reviewed according to the strength of the evidence presented on adverse environmental health outcomes associated with UNGD. The initial searches yielded \&gt; 1000 studies, but this was reduced to 109 relevant studies after the ranking process. Only seven studies were considered highly relevant based on strength of evidence. Articles spanned several relevant topics, but most focussed on impacts on typical environmental media, such as water and air, with much of the health impacts inferred rather than evidenced. Additionally, the majority of studies focussed on short-term, rather than long-term, health impacts, which is expected considering the timeframe of UNGD; therefore, very few studies examined health outcomes with longer latencies such as cancer or developmental outcomes. Current scientific evidence for UNGD that demonstrates associations between adverse health outcomes directly with environmental health hazards resulting from UNGD activities generally lacks methodological rigour. Importantly, however, there is also no evidence to rule out such health impacts. While the current evidence in the scientific research reporting leaves questions unanswered about the actual environmental health impacts, public health concerns remain intense. This is a clear gap in the scientific knowledge that requires urgent attention.},

Processes of resource transformation throughout the ecosystem build order, cycle materials, generate and sustain information. Energy drives all these processes and energetic principles explain much of what is observed, including energy degradation according to the laws of thermodynamics. Emergy, a quantitative measure of the global environmental work supporting ecosystem dynamics, is used here in order to provide a deeper understanding of complexity growth and decline in ecosystems. Ecosystem complexity is discussed in this paper in relation to changes in structure, organization and functional capacity, as explained by changes in emergy, empower, and transformity.},

computing world has been possible because the number
of mobile devices and its capabilities have increased rapidly
over the last decade. While geospatial applications are more
common everyday on mobile devices, applications based on OGC
standards in these devices are still a few. This happens maybe
because the number and size of the standards have been growing
in the last few years as the number of supported use cases
for geospatial data exchange or processing increases at rapid
rates. At the same time, although the capabilities of mobile
phones have increased they are not still powerful enough to
process the large amount of data used frequently to represent
geographical information. In this context, we present in this paper
the implementation of a generic SOS client targeted to Android
mobile phones. The client implements the core profile of the
SOS specifications allowing users the visualisation of sensors and
observations data in tabular or graphical forms. We also discuss
a set of challenges and open issues found during the development
of the application.},

According to the August Forrester Report, 56 percent of IT managers interviewed at Global 2,500 companies are already using some type of open source software in their infrastructure and another 6 percent will install it in the next two years. This revolutionary model for collaborative software development is being embraced and studied by many of the biggest players in the high-tech industry, from Sun Microsystems to IBM to Intel. The Cathedral \& the Bazaaris a must for anyone who cares about the future of the computer industry or the dynamics of the information economy. Already, billions of dollars have been made and lost based on the ideas in this book. Its conclusions will be studied, debated, and implemented for years to come. According to Bob Young, "This is Eric Raymond's great contribution to the success of the open source revolution, to the adoption of Linux-based operating systems, and to the success of open source users and the companies that supply them." The interest in open source software development has grown enormously in the past year. This revised and expanded hardback edition includes new material on open source developments in 1999 and 2000. Raymond's clear and effective writing style accurately describing the benefits of open source software has been key to its success. With major vendors creating acceptance for open source within companies, independent vendors will become the open source story in 2001.},

  abstract = {Emergy Accounting and Synthesis, developed by Howard Odum in the 1980s, accounts for both the work of nature and that of humans as part of it in generating products and services. Since the 1990s, when Odum's system theories and emergy approach were introduced to China, a great attention was paid to them, since they appeared to Chinese scholars very important, comprehensive, and rich with application opportunities to China's economic development and environmental management. Until now more than 150 papers related to emergy theories were published in Chinese scientific journals, more than 20 dissertations presented in all Chinese Universities, and a large number of emergy-based papers were authored by Chinese scholars in international journals. Also, several reports dealing with emergy evaluation of different provinces of China were presented to local governments for decision-making. Emergy theories were applied to valuation of ecosystems and eco-industrial parks, as well as to studies of benefits/cost analysis and feasibility of ecological engineering. Meanwhile, a series of monographs and translated books related to emergy theories were published in China, some of which are used as text books in Chinese universities and institutes. Compared with the great potential of emergy application, there are many new fields that should be addressed in China, including: assessing the environmental impact of processes based on matching of high-quality and low-quality resources, establishing new frameworks and systems for environmental accounting, evaluating natural capital and services and applying research results to the process of decision-making, and finally studying the patterns and the available development options of China regional eco-economic systems.},

  abstract = {Background: Military exercises generate high levels of stress to simulate combat, providing a unique opportunity to examine cognitive and physiologic responses of normal humans to acute stress. Methods: Cognitive and physiologic markers of stress were evaluated before, during, and after an intense training exercise conducted for 53 hours in the heat. Cognitive performance, mood, physical activity, sleep, body composition, hydration, and saliva cortisol, testosterone, and melatonin were assessed. Volunteers were 31 male U.S. Army officers from an elite unit, aged 31.6 \ensuremath{\pm} .4 years. Results: Wrist activity monitors documented that soldiers slept only 3.0 \ensuremath{\pm} .3 hours during the exercise and were active throughout. Volunteers lost 4.1 \ensuremath{\pm} .2 kg (p \ensuremath{<} .001) of weight, predominately water (3.1 \ensuremath{\pm} .3 L) (p \ensuremath{<} .001). Substantial degradation in cognitive function, assessed with computerized tests, occurred. Vigilance, reaction time, attention, memory, and reasoning were impaired (p \ensuremath{<} .001). Mood, including vigor (p \ensuremath{<} .001), fatigue (p \ensuremath{<} .001), confusion (p \ensuremath{<} .001), depression (p \ensuremath{<} .001), and tension (p \ensuremath{<} .002), assessed by questionnaire, deteriorated. The highest cortisol and testosterone levels were observed before the exercise. Conclusions: This study quantifies the overwhelmingly adverse impact of multiple stressors on cognitive performance, mood, and physiologic parameters, during a continuous but brief military exercise conducted by highly motivated, well-trained officers.},

  abstract = {Despite our pretensions to science, modern industrial society is as myth-bound and mystical as any that has preceded it. Our prevailing cultural myth includes a dangerous vision of global sustainability and poverty reduction centered on unlimited economic expansion, ``free'' trade and technological fixes. This paper dissects the modern myth, exposing its conceptual flaws and practical failings. It then proposes an alternative conceptual framework for development derived from ecological economics and ecological footprint analysis. The new framework recognizes that the human enterprise is a subsystem of the ecosphere whose growth is constrained by biophysical limits. If humanity is to seize control of its destiny it must arise above wishful thinking and tribal instinct. Global society needs a new cultural myth rooted in humanity's unique claim to intelligence and self-awareness in the face of danger. Human security depends on equitable development{\textemdash}not growth{\textemdash}within the means of nature. Sustainability with social justice can be achieved only through an unprecedented level of international cooperation rooted in a sense of compassion for both other peoples and other species.},

  abstract = {Unconfined flow of water to wells is related to anisotropy of the aquifer, changes in the coefficient of storage with time, degree of penetration of the pumping well, and position of the water table. Sluggish response of observation wells to changes of head in the aquifer may lead to erroneous analysis of pumping-test data. The manner and extent to which these factors affect water levels have been studied by field observation, by analytical equations, and by electric analogs. The typical S-shaped curves of log drawdown versus log time, observed around wells pumping from water table aquifers, can be explained by an infinity of combinations of possible flow patterns and observation conditions. Equations developed for artesian flow cannot be used for analysis of tests made under water table conditions unless steady-state conditions have been approached or reached. From a practical standpoint the time required to approach steady flow is much greater than the duration of most pumping tests. Thus if pumping tests are to be used for measuring the hydraulic properties of unconfined aquifers, the boundary conditions attending unconfined flow must be recognized in the analysis of test data.},

James Clerk Maxwell famously exploited such formal similarities in what he called the ``method of physical analogy.'' Both Maxwell and Hermann von Helmholtz appealed to the physical analogies between electromagnetism and hydrodynamics in their development of these theories. I argue that a closer historical examination of the different ways in which Maxwell and Helmholtz each deployed this analogy gives further insight into debates about the representational and explanatory power of mathematical models.},

  abstract = {Increased levels of unconjugated bilirubin, the end product of heme catabolism, impair crucial aspects of nerve cell function. In previous studies, we demonstrated that bilirubin toxicity may be due to cell death by apoptosis. To characterize the sequence of events leading to neurotoxicity, we exposed developing rat brain astrocytes and neurons to unconjugated bilirubin and investigated whether changes in membrane dynamic properties can mediate apoptosis. Bilirubin induced a rapid, dose-dependent increase in apoptosis, which was nevertheless preceded by impaired mitochondrial metabolism. Using spin labels and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy analysis of whole cell and isolated mitochondrial membranes exposed to bilirubin, we detected major membrane perturbation. By physically interacting with cell membranes, bilirubin induced an almost immediate increase in lipid polarity sensed at a superficial level. The enhanced membrane permeability coincided with an increase in lipid fluidity and protein mobility and was associated with significant oxidative injury to membrane lipids. In conclusion, apoptosis of nerve cells induced by bilirubin is mediated by its primary effect at physically perturbing the cell membrane. Bilirubin directly interacts with membranes influencing lipid polarity and fluidity, protein order, and redox status. These data suggest that nerve cell membranes are primary targets of bilirubin toxicity.},

  abstract = {Despite the fact that all successful, documented cases of industrial symbiosis to this day have been self-organizing, some authors and development officials have suggested that increased public planning might deliver better results in this respect than spontaneously evolved market coordination. This paper takes an historical approach to suggest that comprehensive planning is unlikely to live up to the expectations of its proponents. The essay is structured as follows. The first section provides short case studies of industrial symbiosis in highly different economic and institutional settings, the essentially free-market regime of Victorian England and communist Hungary (1948-1989). The available evidence suggests that market coordination proved much more favorable to the emergence of industrial symbiosis, despite the elaboration of a comprehensive policy to that effect in Hungary. Insights derived from the so-called "Austrian" critique of central planning are then used to explain this paradox. The analysis presented suggests that the Hungarian planners' failure was not so much the result of the bad implementation of sound policies, but the logical outcome of a top-down approach's shortcomings. Policy implications for the public planning of industrial symbiosis in a mixed economy are then derived and the case for self-organization is found more compelling. The creation of more innovative institutions that will force firms to "internalize their externalities" while leaving them the necessary freedom to innovate is viewed as an urgently needed and promising path towards increased, sustainable reuse of industrial by-products.},

  abstract = {Bilirubin is a well-known neurotoxin that can result in multiple neurologic deficits. Previous studies have suggested that bilirubin affects aspects of synaptic transmission; however the acute effects of bilirubin on synaptic transmission have not been examined in real-time. In this study, using whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings, we observed the effect of bilirubin on inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSC) in postnatal 13-15-day-old neurons dissociated from lateral superior olive nuclei (LSO), one of the brainstem auditory nucleus that are highly vulnerable to bilirubin. The results showed that 10-5�M bilirubin increased the frequency of spontaneous IPSC without causing change in their amplitudes or in the response to bath applied glycine, suggesting a presynaptic locus for the action. In the presence of tetrodotoxin, the frequency of miniature IPSC was also potentiated by 10-5�M bilirubin. The facilitation by bilirubin was concentration dependent and increased with an increase in exposure time. Bicuculline only partially reduced the action of bilirubin. The action of bilirubin was observed in extracellular Ca2+-free ({[}Ca2+{]}o free) solution but was fully occluded by pretreatment with BAPTA-AM in {[}Ca2+{]}o free solution. Thus, in LSO neurons, bilirubin facilitates inhibitory synaptic transmission, in a manner independent of voltage-activated Na+ and Ca2+ channels but dependent on presynaptic {[}Ca2+{]}i. The increase of inhibitory synaptic transmission in response to acute bilirubin is a novel effect of bilirubin on the central nervous system and may have implications for neurotoxicity and the impairment of auditory transduction seen in hyperbilirubinemia.},

  abstract = {Watershed delineation is a process for defining a land area that contributes surface water flow to a single outlet point. It is a commonly used in water resources analysis to define the domain in which hydrologic process calculations are applied. There has been a growing effort over the past decade to improve surface elevation measurements in the U.S., which has had a significant impact on the accuracy of hydrologic calculations. Traditional watershed processing on these elevation rasters, however, becomes more burdensome as data resolution increases. As a result, processing of these datasets can be troublesome on standard desktop computers. This challenge has resulted in numerous works that aim to provide high performance computing solutions to large data, high resolution data, or both. This work proposes an efficient watershed delineation algorithm for use in desktop computing environments that leverages existing data, U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Hydrography Dataset Plus (NHD+), and open source software tools to construct watershed boundaries. This approach makes use of U.S. national-level hydrography data that has been precomputed using raster processing algorithms coupled with quality control routines. Our approach uses carefully arranged data and mathematical graph theory to traverse river networks and identify catchment boundaries. We demonstrate this new watershed delineation technique, compare its accuracy with traditional algorithms that derive watershed solely from digital elevation models, and then extend our approach to address subwatershed delineation. Our findings suggest that the open-source hierarchical network-based delineation procedure presented in the work is a promising approach to watershed delineation that can be used summarize publicly available datasets for hydrologic model input pre-processing. Through our analysis, we explore the benefits of reusing the NHD+ datasets for watershed delineation, and find that the our technique offers greater flexibility and extendability than traditional raster algorithms.},

  abstract = {Electric-analog design criteria are established from the differential equations of ground-water flow for analyzing pumping-test data. A convenient analog design was obtained by transforming the cylindrical equation of flow to a rectilinear form. The design criteria were applied in the construction of an electric analog, which was used for studying pumping-test data collected near Grand Island, Nebr. 

Data analysis indicated (1) vertical flow components near pumping wells in unconfined aquifers may be much more significant in the control of water-table decline than radial flow components for as much as a day of pumping; (2) the specific yield during the first few minutes of pumping appears to be a very small fraction of that observed after pumping for more than 1 day; and (3) estimates of specific yield made from model studies seem much more sensitive to variations in assumed flow conditions than are estimates of permeability. Analysis of pumping-test data where vertical flow components are important requires that the degree of anisotropy be known. A procedure for computing anisotropy directly from drawdowns observed at five points was developed. Results obtained in the analog study emphasize the futility of calculating unconfined aquifer properties from pumping tests of short duration by means of equations based on the assumptions that vertical flow components are negligible and specific yield is constant.},

  abstract = {In this important new work, Howard T. Odum, widely acknowledged as the father of systems ecology, lucidly explains his concept of emergy, a measure of real wealth that provides a rational, science-based method of evaluating commodities, services, and environmental goods. Using specific real-world examples, Dr. Odum clearly demonstrates the revolutionary role of emergy in environmental management and policy making.Environmental Accounting: Emergy and Environmental Decision Making offers environmental professionals--policymakers, managers, ecologists, planners, developers, and activists--a systematic approach to environmental and economic valuation that will eliminate much of the rancor and adversarial decision making that often plagues environmental issues. Specifically, this book: * Describes the theoretical basis, calculation procedures, and applications of emergy * Introduces the concept of "transformity," the ratio of emergy (work put into a product) and energy (value received from the product) * Provides formulas for emergy calculations, procedures for making an emergy evaluation table, and parameters for updating evaluations * Demonstrates the use of emergy to evaluate environments, minerals, waters, primary energy sources, economic developments, and international trade * Compares the emergy approach to environmental evaluation with othersEnvironmental Accounting: Emergy and Environmental Decision Making will help environmental decision makers and the society they serve maximize economic vitality with less trial and error, innovate with fewer failures, and adapt to change more rapidly. It provides the tools they need to arrive at the best policies in resource management, economics, and the environment.Balancing the economy and the environment-- from the father of systems ecologyIncreasing economic dependence on diminishing natural resources has sparked a highly charged debate over the use and fate of the world environment. Environmental Accounting: Emergy and Environmental Decision Making presents a unique method of environmental management based on maximizing real wealth, the whole economy, and the public benefit.Renowned ecologist Howard T. Odum introduces the concept of emergy to provide a rational alternative to the tug-of-war over the world's most vital assets. Emergy measures the energy put into making a product and is the cornerstone of Odum's revolutionary text. This timely and important book offers key insights into: * Determining the real value of a product or service * Transformity, or the relationship between emergy (input) and energy (output) * Stored wealth, available energy, and the final product * Balancing economic and environmental needsEnvironmental Accounting: Emergy and Environmental Decision Making will help economists, ecologists, policymakers, and planners make more responsible, informed decisions to sustain economic and environmental development.},

  title = {Emergy basis of forest systems},
  url = {http://search.proquest.com/docview/304499470?accountid=13552},
  abstract = {A major question in natural resource management is how to integrate economicuse activities with the supporting ecosystems to maximize performance of the ecologicaleconomic system. In this dissertation, the natural wealth of forested systems of three different sizes was evaluated with emergy: two watersheds of the Southern Appalachians, Macon County (N.C.), and North Carolina. Emergy is the total amount of energy of one form that was required directly and indirectly to make another form of energy. Values are reported as emdollars (Em\$) which represent the economic activity resulting from resource use.                 Benefits provided by forested watersheds were quantified based on emergy required to develop and maintain each service or product. Total wealth contributed by the multiple-use Wine Spring Creek (WSC) watershed was 4300 Em\$/ha/y, and was divided among scientific research (3450 Em\$/ha/y), water yield (2060 Em\$/ha/y), recreation (1880 Em\$/ha), and timber (1440 Em\$/ha/y).                 In the 1990's, timber accounted for 3\% of world emergy use, 1\% in the United States, 9\% in North Carolina, 14\% in Macon County, and 8\% in the WSC watershed. Forest ecosystems captured 53\% of environmental emergy in North Carolina, 81\% in Macon County, and 100\% in the WSC watershed. The importance of forest ecosystems to the U.S. economy were evaluated based on emergy flows of the U.S. forest products industry and international trade of forest products in North America. In 1993, the U.S. had an annual trade surplus in forest products worth 63 billion Em\$.                 Simple models were developed to explore the temporal and spatial dynamics of emergy and transformity in forested watersheds. Transformity is the ratio of emergy to energy; it measures position in the energy hierarchy of energy forms. Temporally, transformity and emergy lagged energy levels in reaching steady-state. Spatially, emergy from mountain uplands converged to the stream network, making water and its carved basin locations of high empower density.                 A model, MULTIBEN, evaluated forest empower of multiple benefits given various combinations of economic investment in recreation and timbering. Maximum empower was found at an intermediate level of economic investment, suggesting that an optimum intensity of forest development exists.},

This research evaluates three of the most prominent emerging methods of fossil fuel production{\textemdash}oil from oil/tar sands, shale oil and shale gas, both produced through hydraulic fracturing. In 2013, 42\% of natural gas production and 41\% of oil production in the United States was produced through hydraulic fracturing and \ensuremath{\sim}60\% of new oil and gas wells use the method. In 2013, the Alberta region of Canada produced 1.7 million barrels per day of synthetic crude oil from oil sands, exporting 1.3 million barrels to the US every day, comprising \ensuremath{\sim}7\% of daily US oil consumption. Results from this work show that natural gas obtained through hydraulic fracturing has an emergy yield ratio (EYR) between 4.23 and 9.18, depending on well productivity and whether the gas is ``wet'' (contains other hydrocarbons) or ``dry'' (pure or nearly pure methane). Synthetic crude oil from oil sands was found to have an EYR of 3.38{\textendash}4.06 (in situ vs. mined production, respectively). The EYR of tight oil was found to be 3.43{\textendash}4.73, dependent on the productivity of the well. Given the relatively high current market price of oil and relatively low market price of natural gas the observed results (i.e., similar or higher EYR for natural gas than past observations and a lower EYR for oil than past observations) are expected.},

  abstract = {Emergy (with an `m') synthesis was used to assess the balance between nature and humanity and the equity among forest outcomes of a US Forest Service ecosystem management demonstration project on the Wine Spring Creek watershed, a high-elevation (1600 m), temperate forest located in the southern Appalachian mountains of North Carolina, USA. EM embraces a holistic perspective, accounting for the multiple temporal and spatial scales of forest processes and public interactions, to balance the ecological, economic, and social demands placed on land resources. Emergy synthesis is a modeling tool that allows the structure and function of forest ecosystems to be quantified in common units (solar emergy-joules, sej) for easy and meaningful comparison, determining `system-value' for forcing factors, components, and processes based on the amount of resources required to develop and sustain them, whether they are money, material, energy, or information. The Environmental Loading Ratio (ELR), the units of solar emergy imported into the watershed via human control per unit of indigenous, natural solar emergy, was determined to be 0.42, indicating that the load on the natural environment was not ecologically damaging and that excess ecological capacity existed for increasing non-ecological activities (e.g. timbering, recreation) to achieve an ELR of 1.0 (perfect ecological{\textendash}economic balance). Three forest outcomes selected to represent the three categories of desired sustainability (ecological, economic, and social) were evaluated in terms of their solar emergy flow to measure outcome equity. Direct economic contribution was an order of magnitude less (224{\texttimes}1012 solar emergy-joules (sej) ha-1) than the ecological and social contributions, which were provided at annual rates of 3083 and 2102{\texttimes}1012 sej ha-1, respectively. Emergy synthesis was demonstrated to holistically integrate and quantify the interconnections of a coupled nature-human system allowing the goals of ecological balance and outcome equity to be measured quantitatively.},

SysML is a general purpose graphical modeling language used to specify, analyze, and design systems that may include hardware, software, and personnel. It allows engineers to describe how a system interacts with its environment, and how its parts must interact to achieve the desired system behavior and performance. The SysML model provides a shared view of the system, enabling a design team to surface issues early and prevent problems that would otherwise delay development and degrade design quality. Since SysML is based on UML, it also facilitates integration between systems and software development. SysML is now being adopted by companies across a broad range of industry, including Aerospace and Defense, Automotive, and IT System Developers. This book provides a comprehensive and practical guide for modeling systems with SysML. It includes a full description of the language along with a quick reference guide, and shows how the language can be applied to specify, analyze, and design systems. It contains examples to help readers understand how SysML can be used in practice. The book also includes guidance on how an organization or project can transition to model based systems engineering using SysML, with considerations for processes, methods, tools, and training. *The authoritative guide for understanding and applying SysML *Authored by the foremost experts on the language *Language description, examples, and quick reference guide included},

  abstract = {H.T. Odum originally defined transformity as the amount of energy of one type required to generate a unit of energy of another type with the caveat that the energy production system was operating under competition at optimum loading for maximum power. The caveat has been mostly ignored in emergy evaluations, often because it is difficult to identify when or whether a transformity was produced at maximum empower. We developed the model TechnoPulse to explore the temporally dynamic relationship between transformity and empower. As TechnoPulse cycled through four distinct phases of birth, growth, decline and recovery, maximum empower was accompanied by minimum transformity for the production flow. Conversely, the period of minimum empower corresponded to maximum transformity. After the ``birth'' of the new energy form, the period of growth saw empower increase as tranformity declined. Since transformity is the reciprocal of efficiency, maximizing empower also increased efficiency. We found that the non-pulsing situation had higher empower than pulsing, but that pulsing maximized power and minimized tranformity (maximized efficiency). We found that the national production of electricity in the US followed the pattern observed from the growth portion of the TechnPulse simulation by maximizing empower and minimizing transformity over the period 1995{\textendash}2006. A contrast of two methods for estimating the emergy yield of systems (emergy summation based on common practices and transformity multiplication based on using minimum transformity at maximum empower) applied to PV electricity production revealed starkly different interpretations for PV's role and viability as a primary source of electricity, but more importantly suggested that there is a easy rationale for employing each method. Finally, emergy evaluations can be improved by heeding Odum's original definition of tranformity and using the minimum tranformity corresponding to maximum empower.},

In times of declining resources, this principle translates into increased efficiency and optimum use of any kind of waste and co-products. Ecosystems and any self-organizing systems always apply this strategy and their selection{\textendash}evolution mechanisms are based on their ability of growing on any untapped resource available. In order to do so, they increase the number of components and patterns for resource degradation in order to optimize the resource throughput and power output. Such a strategy also applies to human-dominated, economic systems, where the ability of dealing with co-products and wastes by means of appropriate designs as well as reuse and recycling processes may lead to ``zero-emission'' patterns (increased complexity, optimal resource throughput, minimization of emissions, resource exchange among system's components) and be the key for successful and sustainable development.

  abstract = {If you are interested in collaborating on the current effort to apply the Open System Engineering Environment (OSEE) to the Aerospace and Automotive industries or in learning how OSEE might be applied to your industry, then this BOF is for you.

Industries that build complex, mission-critical systems typically work with many suppliers in order to create a single integrated product. These products often have long development lifecycles and have stringent requirements for verification, traceability, and document deliverables. In order to effectively manage this complexity, these industries are required to assemble a wide array of tools that provide only piecemeal capabilities. Often, the resulting toolset provides disconnected access to partially redundant data and may carry with it multi-million dollar software licensing, customization, and maintenance costs.

OSEE is being developed to provide an integrated solution to these challenges. At the heart of OSEE is an Application Framework which provides a powerful persistence layer allowing applications to utilize a common data model that is accessible to all OSEE applications. Two such applications, that are widely applicable, have already been created: a powerful requirements and document management solution, OSEE Define, and a full featured change management system, OSEE ATS.

The OSEE Eclipse project provides tremendous opportunities to collaborate on industry wide solutions and build upon lessons already learned.},

  abstract = {This paper examines aspects of the case against global oil peaking, and in particular sets out to answer a viewpoint that the world can have abundant supplies of oil "for years to come". Arguments supporting the latter view include: past forecasts of oil shortage have proved incorrect, so current predictions should also be discounted; many modellers depend on Hubbert's analysis but this contained fundamental flaws; new oil supply will result from reserves growth and from the wider deployment of advanced extraction technology; and that the world contains large resources of unconventional oil that can come on-stream if the production of conventional oil declines. These arguments are examined in turn and shown to be incorrect, or to need setting into a broader context. The paper concludes therefore that such arguments cannot be used to rule out calculations that the resource-limited peak in the world's production of conventional oil will occur in the near term. Moreover, peaking of conventional oil is likely to impact the world's total availability of oil where the latter includes non-conventional oil and oil substitutes.},

  abstract = {Abstracts The hydrogen production from photocatalytic water decomposition is one of the best approaches that convert solar energy to hydrogen energy. At present, the hydrogen production from photocatalytic water decomposition has a low efficiency. In order to determine a valuable hydrogen production process from photocatalytic water decomposition in the aspect of energy conversion, the concept of critical conversion efficiency of light energy is proposed in this paper. Critical conversion efficiency of light energy is defined as the conversion efficiency of light energy when the hydrogen energy output is equal to an equivalent energy input of the system. The criterion introduced is that only if the conversion efficiency of light energy is greater than the critical one, an energy profit can be achieved in a system. A hypothetical system with 20,000�tons annual hydrogen production by using Na2S/Na2SO3 as the sacrificial reagent is analyzed and calculated in this paper to determine the critical conversion efficiency of light energy by means of energy balance, cumulative exergy balance, and emergy balance, respectively. The results show that the critical conversion efficiency of light energy determined by emergy balance is the most reasonable, which gives the figure around 15\%.},

Mathematics of self-organi zation may justify "emulation" as the simulation of systems overview without details. Here, these methods are applied to the new fields of "ecological economics" and "ecological engineering." Since the vitality of national economies depends on the symbiotic coupling of environmental resources and human economic behavior, the energy language is adapted to develop overview models of nations relevant to public policies. An overview model of a developing nation is given as an example with simulations for alternative policies. Maximum economic vitality was obtained with trade for external resources, but ultimate economic carrying capacity and standard of living was determined by indige nous resources, optimum utilization and absence of foreign debt.},

  abstract = {This research uses a new approach to study the organization of watersheds and to provide insight for their management. It evaluates work done by water energies on the landscape and explores an hypothesis that "self organizing watersheds couple the geopotential and chemical potential energy use to maximize biological and geological production". Work of water in the mountains was measured by the geopotential energy use and related to work on terrestrial productivity of valleys measured by the chemical potential energy evapotranspired. Using data on rainfall and river flow data and topographic geographic information, spatial and temporal energy analysis and sc EMERGY evaluations were performed for six Brazilian watersheds of the Ribeira de Iguape River basin, and for the Coweeta River basin in North Carolina. sc EMERGY is the energy of one kind used directly and indirectly to make a product or service. Maps and graphs included.                 Evaluations revealed two typical watershed shapes--bowl-shaped and plateau basins. Bowl-shaped basins optimized the use of the water energies, with a ratio of chemical potential energy used to geopotential energy used between 1.3 and 1.5. This ratio was 0.4 to 0.6 for the plateau basins. The geopotential energy use per area and the empower densities for the bowl-shaped basins were maximum at middle elevations, coinciding with cited zones of maximum native biodiversity.                 sc EMERGY of the river waters accumulated through the river network enabled the pulsed delivery of residual geopotential energy, nutrients and sediments to have a large effect on lowland productivity, measured by the high transformities of about 2E6 solar emjoules per joule. About half of the rain chemical potential energy was transferred to estuaries dowstream. From headwaters to delta, transformities of chemical potential energy ranged from 2E4 to 6E4 solar emjoules per joule.                 A computer model simulated changes in the valley productivity due to construction of one or more small dams. Dams reduced flood pulses and decreased floodplain productivity by 15 to 26\%. Multiple small dams minimized the impacts.},

  title = {Emergy evaluation of water},
  url = {http://search.proquest.com/docview/304692621?accountid=13552},
  abstract = {To better understand the values of water within different contexts and spatial scales, the emergy inputs to water were evaluated and compared at four scales: (1) global, (2) regional (the state of Florida), (3) local (water supply utilities), and (4) small-scale (home water purification). Emergy (spelled with an "m") represents all the previous work of one kind required to generate a product or provide a service.                 Since water can be found at all stages of the global hierarchy of biogeochemical processes, it has many emergy values and transformities. Transformities of water indicate the convergence of energy and materials that are required to produce the water. Global water storages were evaluated using the total emergy driving the geobiochemical processes of the biosphere and storage turnover times. Transformities for these water storages varied between 3.54 E3 sej/J (water vapor) and 1.05 E6 sej/J (glaciers). Calculated transformities for global water flows ranged from 3.96 E3 sej/J (precipitation) to 9.55 E5 sej/J (ice melt).                 Regional transformities of water resources reflected specific conditions of the landscape. The mean transformities for water in estuaries, rivers, lakes, wetlands and deep groundwater storages in Florida were calculated at 3.19 E4, 4.26 E4, 5.64 E4, 7.09 E4 and 1.66 E5 sej/J, respectively.                 Eight local water supply utilities in Florida were evaluated to determine the emergy cost of producing potable water. Potable water transformities ranged from 1.39 E5 (West Palm Beach plant) to 1.39 E6 (Stock Island reverse osmosis plant). Five home water purification processes were evaluated to compare the emergy costs of producing potable water just for drinking, yielding transformities between 5.19 E6 (filtered water) and 3.16 E7 sej/J (bottled water).                 To test theories of the appropriate use of water to maximize economic vitality, a computer model of a generalized regional production function was simulated. Using Florida as a case study, maximum total production occurred when the economic/urban sector, the agricultural sector, and the environment received approximately 25, 30, and 45\%, respectively, of the fresh water remaining after evapotranspiration.                 Since the calculated transformities for potable water are equivalent in magnitude to gasoline and electricity, the use of potable water should correspond with its high value. Therefore, measures need to be taken at local and regional levels to use potable water more appropriately.},

Its common unit allows all resources to be compared on a fair basis. As feedstock for fuel ethanol, cassava has some advantages over other feedstocks. The production system of cassava-based fuel ethanol (CFE) was evaluated by emergy analysis. The emergy indices for the system of cassava-based fuel ethanol (CFE) are as follows: transformity is 1.10 E + 5 sej/J, EYR is 1.07, ELR is 2.55, RER is 0.28, and ESI is 0.42. Compared with the emergy indices of wheat ethanol and corn ethanol, CFE is the most sustainable. CFE is a good alternative to substitute for oil in China. Non-renewable purchased emergy accounts for 71.15\% of the whole input emergy. The dependence on non-renewable energy increases environmental degradation, making the system less sustainable relative to systems more dependent on renewable energies. For sustainable development, it is vital to reduce the consumption of non-renewable energy in the production of CFE.},

Management of small-scale fisheries targeting sedentary stocks requires integration of information about processes operating and observable at different spatial and temporal scales. An integrated approach was developed with a scallop (Aequipecten tehuelchus) fishery in a small, semi-enclosed Patagonian basin as a demonstration case. Medium-resolution (30 m2) satellite (Landsat) data, used to identify circulation patterns, were combined with information from fishery surveys and recruitment experiments to link oceanographic processes with population dynamics. A frontal system splits San Jos{\'e} Gulf (northern Argentine Patagonia) into two oceanographic domains (East and West) with distinct hydrographic regimes. In the West Domain, where circulation is highly advective and governed by turbulent vorticial fluxes, larval settlement on artificial collectors was insignificant over five reproductive seasons and no important scallop grounds were ever found. In the East Domain, where the main fishing grounds are, spat abundance varied between sites and years, but was always significant. Growth rates displayed strong clinal variation within the East Domain, decreasing clockwise away from the entrance to the Gulf and reflecting inferred circulation and gradual nutrient extinction. A physical mechanism capable of dispersing larvae over long distances towards the north, into the adjacent San Matias Gulf, was identified from Landsat images. The large-scale patterns of variation in growth, distribution, and recruitment of the Tehuelche scallop stock could not have been interpreted without an integrative approach to data assemblage and analysis, including satellite remote sensing.},

  abstract = {Hypothesized as a universal principle of system self-organization, selection for maximum power provided the basis for H.T. Odum's systems-based understanding of energy transformation dynamics, which ultimately resulted in his emergy-based methods of ecosystem and environmental policy analysis. Odum's formulation of the principle emphasized the selective advantage potentially available to systems that acquire useful energy at the maximum rate possible within their environments, with energy deemed useful if it reinforces production through increased available energy acquisition. Based on this principle, Odum postulated a correspondence of the maintenance requirements of energy fluxes with their contributions to system power acquisition. A quantitative correlate with usefulness is thus provided by emergy, i.e., by the available energy of one kind used directly or indirectly to maintain storages and flows. A more explicit and precise understanding of the energetics of self-organization was thus suggested, and Odum accordingly reformulated the principle as selection for maximum rate of emergy acquisition (i.e., empower), which provides the standard for assessment of system adaptedness in current methods of emergy analysis. The many corollary hypotheses derived from the principle include the selective prevalence of intermediate efficiencies and process rates and of pulsing dynamics, emergy hierarchies, and territoriality under appropriate energy-influx regimes. Assessments of socioeconomic and environmental alternatives might be further improved by integrating this principle with modern theories of multilevel selection.},

The concepts evolved over decades, beginning in the 1950s with Odum's work on tracing energy flows in ecosystems. During the 1970s, Odum's attention was drawn to larger scale systems that included the economies of humans and the concept of net energy. In the 1980s, Odum quantified energy quality and defined it as a ``donor-based'' evaluation technique. In the 1990s, energy quality was further refined and rigorous definitions for ``emergy'' and ``transformity'' were given. The units of emergy were defined as solar emjoules (abbreviated seJ) and the units of transformity were seJ/J. In addition, we provide some insights into the types of processes and systems that have been evaluated using emergy methods.},

In the present study, we searched the possible toxic effect of bilirubin on differentiated rat oligodendrocytes. Bilirubin was added to oligodendrocyte cultures at different concentrations varied between 10 and 100 {[}mu{]}M, and cultures were incubated for different times (24, 48 and 72 h). Cell viability was evaluated by trypan blue exclusion. The results showed that bilirubin decreased oligodendroglial cell viability in a concentration and time-dependent manner. Bilirubin induced apoptotic cell death as revealed by TUNEL staining and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. We found that bilirubin induced inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS) mRNA expression in rat oligodendrocytes. Bilirubin also increased oligodendroglial nitrite production in a concentration-dependent manner and NOS inhibitor partly blocked bilirubin-induced cytotoxicity. These results suggest that bilirubin induces cytotoxicity, at least partly, via the induction of nitric oxide production in oligodendrocytes.},

It is demonstrated here through textual analysis that Engels criticized not the entropy law itself but the extrapolation of this into the "heat death theory of the universe" hypothesis. The historical debate surrounding this hypothesis is examined, showing that Engels and Marx remained consistent with the natural science of their day. This opens the way to the recognition that Marx's political economy was unique in the 19th century in incorporating thermodynamics into the core of its analysis, thus providing the foundations for an ecological economics. The materialist-dialectical view of classical Marxism led to a dynamic, open, contingent approach to the earth system, reflecting a general evolutionary perspective.},

  abstract = {Background
Military exercises generate high levels of stress to simulate combat, providing a unique opportunity to examine cognitive and physiologic responses of normal humans to acute stress.Methods
Cognitive and physiologic markers of stress were evaluated before, during, and after an intense training exercise conducted for 53 hours in the heat. Cognitive performance, mood, physical activity, sleep, body composition, hydration, and saliva cortisol, testosterone, and melatonin were assessed. Volunteers were 31 male U.S. Army officers from an elite unit, aged 31.6 \ensuremath{\pm} .4 years.Results
Wrist activity monitors documented that soldiers slept only 3.0 \ensuremath{\pm} .3 hours during the exercise and were active throughout. Volunteers lost 4.1 \ensuremath{\pm} .2 kg (p \ensuremath{<} .001) of weight, predominately water (3.1 \ensuremath{\pm} .3 L) (p \ensuremath{<} .001). Substantial degradation in cognitive function, assessed with computerized tests, occurred. Vigilance, reaction time, attention, memory, and reasoning were impaired (p \ensuremath{<} .001). Mood, including vigor (p \ensuremath{<} .001), fatigue (p \ensuremath{<} .001), confusion (p \ensuremath{<} .001), depression (p \ensuremath{<} .001), and tension (p \ensuremath{<} .002), assessed by questionnaire, deteriorated. The highest cortisol and testosterone levels were observed before the exercise.Conclusions
This study quantifies the overwhelmingly adverse impact of multiple stressors on cognitive performance, mood, and physiologic parameters, during a continuous but brief military exercise conducted by highly motivated, well-trained officers.},

The world of family systems psychology identifies a dysfunctional process, called psychological fusion, which stems from insufficient self-definition by an individual and results in a dependency upon others to meet an innate need to feel accepted. People suffering from psychological fusion perceive any criticism as a threat, making it impossible for them to receive the critical feedback that is necessary for growth. To experience intrinsic motivation, people require a sense of relative self-determination and competence. This paper argues that much as employers take an interest in such emotional health issues as substance abuse and stress, they should also address psychological fusion; the paper offers methods for dealing with this interpersonal communications issue},

This article, the second of a pair, examines the use of Sankey diagrams in operational material flow management. The previous article described the development of the diagram and its use in the past. Simple Sankey diagrams follow the requirement of conservation of energy or mass and allow a physical view of production systems. Advanced diagrams integrate stocks of materials beside the flows or show the different (ecological) quality of the materials. For the purpose of management, however, a further step is necessary: to illustrate the economic value of the energy and material flows and to use information from cost accounting. The use of flow charts showing added value or the costs of energy and material flows is particularly important for production systems. This article describes examples of each of these uses as well as assumptions that must be taken into account for Sankey diagrams to be used as an effective aid for decision-making in business and public policy.},

In a series of preliminary studies, student understanding of the Atwood's machine was examined after this topic had been covered in a typical calculus-based course. Analysis of the data revealed that many students had serious difficulties with the acceleration, the internal and external forces, and the role of the string. The present study was undertaken to obtain more detailed information about the nature and prevalence of these difficulties and thus provide a sound basis for the design of more effective instruction. The context for the investigation is a group of related problems involving less complicated compound systems. Specific examples illustrate how this research, which was conducted primarily in a classroom setting, has served as a guide in the development of tutorial materials to supplement the lectures and textbook in a standard introductory course.},

The coefficient of vertical permeability, P z'averaged 365 gpd per square foot. Computed drawdown for the pumped well, based on this value, differed by only a small amount from the observed drawdown. The coefficient of storage, determined from type curves for an image well system, averaged 0.20, typical of unconfined aquifers. Application of the method required a thorough knowledge of geohydrologic controls operating at the test site.},

  abstract = {The impact of human activities on natural systems has grown to the point that we need to engage consciously in earth systems engineering and management. I address why this is the case, and what I mean by such a provocative term. In addition, I explore what we can learn from relevant experience, and how this daunting task should be approached. Earth systems engineering and management (ESEM) may be defined as the capability to rationally engineer and manage human technology systems and related elements of natural systems in such a way as to provide the requisite functionality while facilitating the active management of strongly coupled natural systems. The need for ESEM arises because, as a result of the industrial revolution and concomitant changes in agriculture, population levels, culture, and human systems, the world has become a human artifact. Partially because this process has occurred over time frames that are longer than individual time horizons, and has involved institutions and technology systems rather than conscious individual decisions, recognition of this phenomenon, and appropriate responses, have yet to occur. It is apparent that the science and technology, institutional, and ethical infrastructures necessary to support such a response have not yet been developed. The issue is not whether the earth will be engineered by the human species, it is whether humans will do so rationally, intelligently, and ethically},

  abstract = {The emergy algebra is based on four rules, the use of which is sometimes confusing or reserved only to the experts of the domain. The emergy computation does not obey conservation logic (i.e. emergy computation does not obey Kirchoff-like circuit law). In this paper the authors propose to reformulate the emergy rules into three axioms which provide (i) a rigourous mathematical framework for emergy computation and (ii) an exact recursive algorithm to compute emergy within a system of interconnected processes at steady state modeled by an oriented graph named the emergy graph.

Because emergy algebra follows a logic of memorization, the evaluation principles deal with paths in the emergy graph. The underlying algebraic structure is the set of non-negative real numbers operated on by three processes, the maximum (max), addition (+) and multiplication (\ensuremath{\cdot}). The maximum is associated with the co-product problem. Addition is linked with the split problem or with the independence of two emergy flows. And multiplication is related to the logic of memorization. The axioms describe how to use the different operators max, + and \ensuremath{\cdot} to combine flows without any confusion or ambiguity. The method is tested on five benchmark emergy examples.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an emergy evaluation of the biogeochemical process of petroleum formation. Unlike the previous calculation, in which the transformity of crude oil was back calculated from the relative efficiency of electricity production and factors relating coal to transportation fuels and transportation fuels to crude oil, we analyzed the geochemical process of petroleum formation (naftogenesis) to determine the transformities of oil and natural gas. We assumed that the process of oil and gas production is a steady state process in which all the emergy required is captured in the initial input. For such a system, we can use the mass concentration of the initial input to determine the specific emergy and transformity of the products. We used the maximum photosynthetic yield in Joules of phytoplankton organic matter per Joule of sunlight as the starting point. From this initial assumption, we traced the energy transformations in the oil and gas formation process through photosynthesis, death and decay of the phytoplankton, and diagenesis to kerogen production and from kerogen through catagenesis to petroleum formation. Our results show that both methods converge to similar values for oil (54,200 solar emJoules per Joule (sej/J)) and petroleum natural gas (43,500 sej/J) increasing our confidence in the results of past emergy analyses and providing a firm basis for the calculation of transformities for oil and gas derivatives.},

The LDH activity in the culture medium was an index of cytolysis and the MTT assay was used as an index of mitochondrial impairment. The ratios producing half-maximum cell lysis after 24, 48, and 72h, were 1.1, 0.9 and 0.85, for astrocytes, and 1.2, 0.75 and 0.75, for fibroblasts. Mitochondrial activity decreased after 24 h for ratio = 0.7 and partly recovered at 48 h. Mitochondrial activity was more impaired in fibroblasts than in astrocytes above ratio = 0.7.

  abstract = {Solar Emergy is the available solar energy used up directly and indirectly to make a service or product. Although this basic concept is quite straightforward, its implications are potentially profound. H.T. Odum pioneered the development and use of emergy, and presented it as a way of understanding the behavior of self-organized systems, valuing ecological goods and services, and jointly analyzing ecological and economic systems. Unfortunately, like many groundbreaking ideas, emergy has encountered a lot of resistance and criticism, particularly from economists, physicists, and engineers. Some critics have focused on detailed practical aspects of the approach, while others have taken issue with specific parts of the theory and claims. This paper discusses the main features and criticisms of emergy and provides insight into the relationship between emergy and concepts from engineering thermodynamics, such as exergy and cumulative exergy consumption. This reveals the close link between emergy and ecological cumulative exergy consumption, and indicates that most of the criticisms of emergy are either common to all holistic approaches that account for ecosystems and other macrosystems within their systems boundaries, or a result of misunderstandings derived from a lack of communication between various disciplines, or are not relevant for engineering applications. By identifying the main points of criticisms of emergy, this paper attempts to clarify many of the common misconceptions about emergy, inform the community of emergy practitioners about the aspects that need to be communicated better or improved, and suggest solutions. Further research and interaction with other disciplines is essential to bring one of H.T. Odum's finest contributions into the mainstream to guide humanity on ``the prosperous way down.''},

Manag. Rev. 6(2):13{\textendash}39, 1965), and Black and Scholes (J. Polit. Econ. 81(3):637{\textendash}654, 1973). Essentially, all models are wrong in the sense that they simplify reality. However, there are numerous models available to model particular phenomena of financial markets and calculated option prices, hedging strategies, portfolio allocations, etc. depend on the chosen model. This gives rise to the question which model to choose from the rich pool of available models and, second, how to determine the correct parameters after having selected some specific model class. Thus, one is exposed to both model and parameter risk (or uncertainty). In this survey, we first provide an inside view into the principles of stochastic modeling, illustrated with examples from mathematical finance. Afterwards, we define model risk and uncertainty according to Knight (Risk, uncertainty, and profit, Hart, Schaffner \& Marx, Chicago, 1921) and present some methods how to deal with model risk and uncertainty.},

  abstract = {Current macroeconomic policy promotes continuous economic growth. Unemployment, poverty and debt are associated with insufficient growth. Economic activity depends upon the transformation of natural materials, ultimately returning to the environment as waste. Current levels of economic throughput exceed the planet's carrying capacity. As a result of poorly constructed economic institutions, society faces the unacceptable choice between ecological catastrophe and human misery. A transition to a steady-state economy is required, characterized by a rate of throughput compatible with planetary boundaries. This paper contributes to the development of a steady-state economy by addressing US monetary and fiscal policies. A steady-state monetary policy would support counter-cyclical, debt-free vertical money creation through the public sector, in ways that contribute to sustainable well-being. The implication for a steady-state fiscal policy is that any lending or spending requires a careful balance of recovery of money, not as a means of revenue, but as an economic imperative to meet monetary policy goals.  A steady-state fiscal policy would prioritize targeted public goods investments, taxation of ecological ``bads'' and economic rent and implementation of progressive tax structures. Institutional innovations are considered, including common asset trusts, to regulate throughput, and a public monetary trust, to strictly regulate money supply.},

Four examples are given of the application of the method to the problem of the seepage of water through dams. In two cases the faces of the dams were assumed to be sloping, and in the others they were taken as vertical, the free surface and velocity distributions at the faces of one of the latter cases checking closely with those derived from an analytical solution of the problem.

  abstract = {This paper provides an integrated study on the ecological account for the Chinese economy in 2004 based on emergy synthesis theory. The detailed flows of the Chinese economy is diagramed, accounted and analyzed in categories using the biophysically based ecological accounting. Through calculating environmental and economic inputs within and outside the Chinese economy, this paper discusses the Chinese international exchange, describes the resource structure, and assesses its sustainability as a whole. Also, the comparison of systematic indicators, such as emergy/dollar ratio, environmental load ratio, and emergy self-support ratio, with those of the other countries is tabled and explored to illustrate the general status of the Chinese economy in the world. Take, for example, the environmental load ratio, which was 9.29 in China 2004, it reveals that the Chinese economy put high pressure on the local environment compared with those of the environment-benign countries, such as Brazil (0.75), Australia (0.86) and New Zealand (0.81). In addition, in this paper, the accounting method of tourism is adjusted based on the previous researches.},

I address why this is the case, and what I mean by such a provocative term. In addition, I explore what we can learn from relevant experience, and how this daunting task should be approached. Earth systems engineering and management (ESEM) may be defined as the capability to rationally engineer and manage human technology systems and related elements of natural systems in such a way as to provide the requisite functionality while facilitating the active management of strongly coupled natural systems. The need for ESEM arises because, as a result of the industrial revolution and concomitant changes in agriculture, population levels, culture, and human systems, the world has become a human artifact. Partially because this process has occurred over time frames that are longer than individual time horizons, and has involved institutions and technology systems rather than conscious individual decisions, recognition of this phenomenon, and appropriate responses, have yet to occur. It is apparent that the science and technology, institutional, and ethical infrastructures necessary to support such a response have not yet been developed. The issue is not whether the earth will be engineered by the human species, it is whether humans will do so rationally, intelligently, and ethically},

  abstract = {Most programming languages contain good and bad parts, but JavaScript has more than its share of the bad, having been developed and released in a hurry before it could be refined. This authoritative book scrapes away these bad features to reveal a subset of JavaScript that's more reliable, readable, and maintainable than the language as a whole{\textemdash}a subset you can use to create truly extensible and efficient code.  Considered the JavaScript expert by many people in the development community, author Douglas Crockford identifies the abundance of good ideas that make JavaScript an outstanding object-oriented programming language-ideas such as functions, loose typing, dynamic objects, and an expressive object literal notation. Unfortunately, these good ideas are mixed in with bad and downright awful ideas, like a programming model based on global variables.  When Java applets failed, JavaScript became the language of the Web by default, making its popularity almost completely independent of its qualities as a programming language. In JavaScript: The Good Parts, Crockford finally digs through the steaming pile of good intentions and blunders to give you a detailed look at all the genuinely elegant parts of JavaScript, including: Syntax Objects Functions Inheritance Arrays Regular expressions Methods Style Beautiful features The real beauty? As you move ahead with the subset of JavaScript that this book presents, you'll also sidestep the need to unlearn all the bad parts. Of course, if you want to find out more about the bad parts and how to use them badly, simply consult any other JavaScript book.  With JavaScript: The Good Parts, you'll discover a beautiful, elegant, lightweight and highly expressive language that lets you create effective code, whether you're managing object libraries or just trying to get Ajax to run fast. If you develop sites or applications for the Web, this book is an absolute must.},

His approach is to specify style as the domain of a language of painting, to show that style is syntactical and to argue that shapes are the primitive syntactic elements of style. His essay relates current research on the development of syntax for picture-reading machines to the question of syntax for paintings.},

  abstract = {A series of satellite-based passive and active microwave instruments provide soil moisture retrievals spanning altogether more than three decades. This offers the opportunity to generate a combined product that incorporates the advantages of both microwave techniques and spans the observation period starting 1979. However, there are several challenges in developing such a dataset, e.g., differences in instrument specifications result in different absolute soil moisture values, the global passive and active microwave retrieval methods produce conceptually different quantities, and products vary in their relative performances depending on vegetation density. This paper presents an approach for combining four passive microwave products from the VU University Amsterdam/National Aeronautics and Space Administration and two active microwave products from the Vienna University of Technology. First, passive microwave soil moisture retrievals from the Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR), the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I), and the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission microwave imager (TMI) instruments were scaled to the climatology of the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer {\textemdash} Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) derived product and then all four were combined into a single merged passive microwave product. Second, active microwave soil moisture estimates from the European Remote Sensing (ERS) Scatterometer instrument were scaled to the climatology of the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) derived estimates. Both were combined into a merged active microwave product. Finally, the two merged products were rescaled to a common globally available reference soil moisture dataset provided by a land surface model (GLDAS-1-Noah) and then blended into a single passive/active product. Blending of the active and passive data sets was based on their respective sensitivity to vegetation density. While this three step approach imposes the absolute values of the land surface model dataset to the final product, it preserves the relative dynamics (e.g., seasonality and inter-annual variations) of the original satellite derived retrievals. More importantly, the long term changes evident in the original soil moisture products were also preserved. The method presented in this paper allows the long term product to be extended with data from other current and future operational satellites. The multi-decadal blended dataset is expected to enhance our basic understanding of soil moisture in the water, energy and carbon cycles.},

  abstract = {The emergy and exergy of genetic information and its biological carriers are evaluated. Emergy used to build and maintain biological organisms (which we suggest are the carriers of genetic information analogous to books or a communications network) was evaluated on an areal basis using average global emergy input to the biosphere. The chemical exergy of genes is calculated relative to detritus as the reference environment. Using generalized data for populations of organisms from bacteria to large mammals, an emergy{\textendash}exergy ratio for genes and solar transformities of biomass are calculated. The exergy used to maintain genetic information is shown to be between about 0.1 and 1000 MJ/m2. The emergy{\textendash}exergy ratio for gene maintenance (a measure of the emergy required per Joule of genetic information is between about 1.0 and 20,000 sej/J. Generalized solar transformities for organisms are calculated and vary between about 2 sej/J of biomass (soil bacteria) to 75 million sej/J (mammel biomass). An interesting relationship between the emergy costs of gene maintenance and the solar transformity of biomass leads us to conclude that as the complexity of the biological carrier of information increases, the emergy costs of maintaining the carrier increases faster than the information carried. We propose that the emergy required to generate the genetic information contained in the biosphere today is enormous and we suggest that it might be on the order of 2{\texttimes}1010 sej/J of genetic information.},

  abstract = {H.T. Odum originally defined transformity as the amount of energy of one type required to generate a unit of energy of another type with the caveat that the energy production system was operating under competition at optimum loading for maximum power. The caveat has been mostly ignored in emergy evaluations, often because it is difficult to identify when or whether a transformity was produced at maximum empower. We developed the model TechnoPulse to explore the temporally dynamic relationship between transformity and empower. As TechnoPulse cycled through four distinct phases of birth, growth, decline and recovery, maximum empower was accompanied by minimum transformity for the production flow. Conversely, the period of minimum empower corresponded to maximum transformity. After the ``birth'' of the new energy form, the period of growth saw empower increase as tranformity declined. Since transformity is the reciprocal of efficiency, maximizing empower also increased efficiency. We found that the non-pulsing situation had higher empower than pulsing, but that pulsing maximized power and minimized tranformity (maximized efficiency). We found that the national production of electricity in the US followed the pattern observed from the growth portion of the TechnPulse simulation by maximizing empower and minimizing transformity over the period 1995{\textendash}2006. A contrast of two methods for estimating the emergy yield of systems (emergy summation based on common practices and transformity multiplication based on using minimum transformity at maximum empower) applied to PV electricity production revealed starkly different interpretations for PV's role and viability as a primary source of electricity, but more importantly suggested that there is a easy rationale for employing each method. Finally, emergy evaluations can be improved by heeding Odum's original definition of tranformity and using the minimum tranformity corresponding to maximum empower.},

  abstract = {Transformity is one of the core concepts in Energy Systems Theory and it is fundamental to the calculation of emergy. Accurate evaluation of transformities and other emergy per unit values is essential for the broad acceptance, application and further development of emergy methods. Since the rules for the calculation of emergy are different from those for energy, particular calculation methods and models have been developed for use in the emergy analysis of networks, but double counting errors still occur because of errors in applying these rules when estimating the emergies of feedbacks and co-products. In this paper, configurations of network energy flows were classified into seven types based on commonly occurring combinations of feedbacks, splits, and co-products. A method of structuring the network equations for each type using the rules of emergy algebra, which we called "preconditioning" prior to calculating transformities, was developed to avoid double counting errors in determining the emergy basis for energy flows in the network. The results obtained from previous approaches, the Track Summing Method, the Minimum Eigenvalue Model and the Linear Optimization Model, were reviewed in detail by evaluating a hypothetical system, which included several types of interactions and two inputs. A Matrix Model was introduced to simplify the calculation of transformities and it was also tested using the same hypothetical system. In addition, the Matrix Model was applied to two real case studies, which previously had been analyzed using the existing method and models. Comparison of the three case studies showed that if the preconditioning step to structure the equations was missing, double counting would lead to large errors in the transformity estimates, up to 275 percent for complex flows with feedback and co-product interactions. After preconditioning, the same results were obtained from all methods and models. The Matrix Model reduces the complexity of the Track Summing Method for the analysis of complex systems, and offers a more direct and understandable link between the network diagram and the matrix algebra, compared with the Minimum Eigenvalue Model or the Linear Optimization Model.},

  abstract = {A parameter-optimization process (model calibration) is usually required for numerical model applications, which involves the use of an objective function to determine the model cost (model-data errors). The sum of square errors (SSR) has been widely adopted as the objective function in various optimization procedures. However, `square error' calculation was found to be more sensitive to extreme or high values. Thus, we proposed that the sum of absolute errors (SAR) may be a better option than SSR for model calibration. To test this hypothesis, we used two case studies{\textemdash}a hydrological model calibration and a biogeochemical model calibration{\textemdash}to investigate the behavior of a group of potential objective functions: SSR, SAR, sum of squared relative deviation (SSRD), and sum of absolute relative deviation (SARD). Mathematical evaluation of model performance demonstrates that `absolute error' (SAR and SARD) are superior to `square error' (SSR and SSRD) in calculating objective function for model calibration, and SAR behaved the best (with the least error and highest efficiency). This study suggests that SSR might be overly used in real applications, and SAR may be a reasonable choice in common optimization implementations without emphasizing either high or low values (e.g., modeling for supporting resources management).},

  abstract = {It is well established that high levels of unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) can be toxic to the central nervous system, and oxidative stress is emerging as a relevant event in the mechanisms of UCB encephalopathy. In contrast, the hydrophilic bile acid, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), has been reported as a cytoprotective and antioxidant molecule. In this study, we investigated if exposure of rat neurons in primary culture to clinically relevant concentrations of UCB leads to oxidative injury. The contribution of oxidative stress in UCB neurotoxicity was further investigated by examining whether the reduction of NO production by NAME, an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, prevents the disruption of the redox status and neuronal damage. Moreover, we evaluated the ability of glycoursodeoxycholic acid (GUDCA), the most relevant conjugated derivative in the serum of patients treated with UDCA, to abrogate the UCB-induced oxidative damage. Cultured rat neurons were incubated with 50 or 100 \ensuremath{\mu}M UCB in the presence of 100 \ensuremath{\mu}M human serum albumin, alone or in combination with 100 \ensuremath{\mu}M NAME or with 50 \ensuremath{\mu}M GUDCA, for 4 h at 37 {\textdegree}C. Protein carbonyls, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal-protein adducts, intracellular glutathione content and cell death were determined. The results obtained showed that UCB induces protein oxidation and lipid peroxidation, while diminishes the thiol antioxidant defences, events that were correlated with the extent of cell death. Moreover, these events were counteracted by NAME and abrogated in the presence of GUDCA. Collectively, this study shows that oxidative stress is one of the pathways associated with neuronal viability impairment by UCB, and that GUDCA significantly prevents such effects from occurring. These findings corroborate the antioxidant properties of the bile acid and point to a new therapeutic approach for UCB-induced neurotoxicity due to oxidative stress.

Insights from the energetics of ecological food chains suggest the need to redefine work, distinguishing kinds of energy with a new quantity, the transformity (energy of one type required per unit of another). Transformities may be used as an energy-scaling factor for the hierarchies of the universe including information. Solar transformities in the biosphere, expressed as solar emjoules per joule, range from one for solar insolation to trillions for categories of shared information. Resource contributions multiplied by their transformities provide a scientifically based value system for human service, environmental mitigation, foreign trade equity, public policy alternatives, and economic vitality.},

  abstract = {Although shale energy development can bring infusions of money and jobs to local communities, an array of risks to community-level assets and institutions is also possible. Sociological research dating back to the 1970s links rapid oil and gas development with overburdened municipal services, upended social and cultural patterns, and volatile economic growth. Research on technological risk has demonstrated communities can come to be associated with pollution and contamination, resulting in out-migration, declining amenity-led development, and decreased financial investment. Emerging shale energy case studies in Wyoming, Pennsylvania, North Dakota, and Texas show a similar, although nuanced, picture of these concerns. Yet, little data exists on the prevalence or magnitude of these risks in the current context of shale gas development. The existing research has largely remained case-based in nature, has not been synthesized across various disciplines, and has not been updated to account for various social and technological trends that have occurred since its publication. This paper offers a critical review of major research endeavors that inform our knowledge of risk to communities from shale energy development, while identifying gaps in our understanding of these risks and areas of research need.},

We hypothesized that previous results may reflect the neurophysiological consequences of patterns of effort requirements; that is, high-effort expenditure from lower aptitude participants (for whom the problems are hard) and low-effort expenditure from higher aptitude participants (for whom the problems are easy). In this experiment, positron emission tomography (PET) data were gathered on participants (N = 28) who solved easy and hard problems that were tailored to the participants' own ability levels, thereby eliminating aptitude group differences in effort requirements. Contrary to previous results, high aptitude was associated with high cortical glucose use. Average aptitude participants showed diminished glucose use in the hard condition. A significant Group X Condition X Hemisphere Effect was also noted, with greater right hemisphere activation in the hard condition for the high-aptitude group. These results demonstrate that the relation of cerebral glucose use and cognitive ability is sensitive to participant and task selection.},

Those tools were intended to support action research for a project in interprofessional educational development. The intention with using those tools was two-fold: first, they were expected to help structure the analysis of the problem situation that the project was to address; second, they were to facilitate and document the project management process itself, by allowing for the different voices within the interprofessional project team to be heard. The paper relates how the tools functioned relatively successfully as analytical devices for the action researcher, but did not significantly contribute to further interprofessional collaboration or enhance dialogue between the action researcher and the project members. Issues of how to use the tools to support more effectively the existing dialogue across professional cultures and traditions are discussed.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the use of systems engineering in analysis and optimization of gas export system operation. The Norwegian dry gas export system is selected as the subject for the analysis. The gas export system at the Norwegian Continental Shelf is the largest offshore gas transport network in the world, and it consists of many components, such as pipelines, platforms, processing and exit terminals, and many routing possibilities. There are two important factors that a gas export system shall satisfy. First, the system shall secure that the customers receive the gas that they have ordered. Second, the system shall do this in as energy efficient way as possible, i.e., minimize operating costs and environmental emissions. For the operator of gas export systems it is of vital importance that equipments and pipelines in the system are optimally integrated. This will secure flexibility, capability, availability and energy efficiency of the system, and enhance understanding between different system operators. Operational experience shows that there is a substantial need to analyze the integration between the system components and the effects on optimum operation, energy consumption and environmental emissions. The objective of this work is to demonstrate how systems engineering and information models have been applied as tools for analyzing the integration in and overcoming the complexity of gas export systems and system operation, and further for developing models that optimize the energy efficiency of system operation. {\textcopyright} 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The following essay addresses this period of history from an energy perspective and suggests, as others have, that the surplus energy of a nation is its basis for power. Sweden's energy came mainly from its forests which supplied its mines with wood and its metal-works with charcoal. This energy system, including hydropower, animal and man power, is analyzed using one of the thousands of charcoal-burners as a model for the main energy input - charcoal. The principles of sustainable use of Swedish forests are also addressed in an historical perspective.},

This is because entropy losses due to excited state generation and relaxation are extremely small ({[}Delta{]}S \ensuremath{<<} T/Tr) and are essentially associated with the absorption-fluorescence Stokes shift. Total entropy changes associated with primary photochemistry for single photosystems are shown to depend critically on the thermodynamic efficiency of the process. This principle is applied to the case of primary photochemistry of the isolated core of higher plant photosystem I and photosystem II, which are demonstrated to have maximal thermodynamic efficiencies of {[}xi{]} \ensuremath{>} 0.98 and {[}xi{]} \ensuremath{>} 0.92 respectively, and which, in principle, function with negative entropy production. It is demonstrated that for the case of {[}xi{]} \ensuremath{>} (1 - T/Tr) entropy production is always negative and only becomes positive when {[}xi{]} \ensuremath{<} (1 - T/Tr).},

Stein begins with an overview of Perl's increasingly powerful networking facilities; then introduces Berkeley Sockets, and the UDP and TCP protocols at the heart of network programming. He presents Perl's IO:: socket API, which simplifies the creation and use of sockets; demonstrates how to create forking servers; and introduces practical techniques for creating multithreaded and multiplexed applications. Modeled upon the style of Stevens, and using extensive sample code, Stein demonstrates all of the key features.

Accumulation of UCB in the CSF and CNS is limited by its active export, probably mediated by MRP1/Mrp1 present in choroid plexus epithelia, capillary endothelia, astrocytes and neurons. Upregulation of MRP1/Mrp1 protein levels by UCB might represent an important adaptive mechanism that protects the CNS from UCB toxicity. These concepts could explain the varied susceptibility of newborns to bilirubin neurotoxicity and the occurrence of neurological damage at plasma UCB concentrations well below therapeutic guidelines, and are relevant to the increasing prevalence of bilirubin encephalopathy in newborns.},

  abstract = {Bilirubin binding to albumins of different species has been studied with stopped-flow measurements of protein fluorescence quenching and the appearance of bilirubin fluorescence. Binding, itself, as indicated by quenching of protein fluorescence, occurs at an immeasurably fast rate. The visible fluorescence of bilirubin, however, appears more slowly. The development of this fluorescence is a first-order process with a half-time of 50-100 msec, depending on the species of albumin, and may be related to the relaxation of bilirubin to a helical conformation. A slower secondary quenching of protein fluorescence occurs after the initial quenching associated with binding itself. The secondary process reduces the already quenched fluorescence by another 50\%, is a first-order reaction, and has a half-time of 300-400 msec. From energy transfer calculations, a 4 � migration of bound bilirubin along the albumin binding crevice toward tryptophans could account for this degree of secondary quenching, but a protein conformational change is not ruled out. Multiple relaxation processes in macromolecular binding may prove to be rather general phenomena.},

This method of ``learning by doing'' is implemented in Queensland primarily through the imposition of layered monitoring and reporting duties on the coal seam gas operator alongside obligations to compensate and ``make good'' harm caused. The purpose of this article is to provide a critical review of the Queensland regulatory approach to the approval and minimisation of adverse impacts from coal seam gas activities. Following an overview of the hallmarks of an effective adaptive management approach, this article begins by addressing the mosaic of approval processes and impact assessment regimes that may apply to coal seam gas projects. This includes recent Strategic Cropping Land reforms. This article then turns to consider the preconditions for land access in Queensland and the emerging issues for landholders relating to the negotiation of access and compensation agreements. This article then undertakes a critical review of the environmental duties imposed on coal seam gas operators relating to hydraulic fracturing, well head leaks, groundwater management and the disposal and beneficial use of produced water. Finally, conclusions are drawn regarding the overall effectiveness of the Queensland framework and the lessons that may be drawn from Queensland's adaptive environmental management approach.},

Cytotoxicity increased at pH 7.6 and below. Albumin-bound bilirubin was nontoxic to tissue culture cells. Albumin added to bilirubin-treated cells resulted in extraction of significant quantities of the cellular-bound bilirubin. However, even when the albumin was added as rapidly as 1 minute after the bilirubin to cells there was still some loss in cell viability. Uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation and inhibitors of NADH oxidase activity, unlike bilirubin, neither decreased cell viability nor brought about the loss of soluble proteins from cells. Bilirubin more closely resembled agents such as deoxycholate that affect cell membranes in bringing about the loss of cellular proteins. The suggestion is made that the electron-transport lesion induced by bilirubin may not in itself bring about cell death, but that the primary lethal lesion may be on multiple cell membrane systems, perhaps brought about by some alteration of membrane lipids.},

  abstract = {The Sankey diagram is an important aid in identifying inefficiencies and potential for savings when dealing with resources. It was developed over 100�years ago by the Irish engineer Riall Sankey to analyze the thermal efficiency of steam engines and has since been applied to depict the energy and material balances of complex systems. The Sankey diagram is the main tool for visualizing industrial metabolism and hence is widely used in industrial ecology. In the history of the early 20th century, it played a major role when raw materials were scarce and expensive and engineers were making great efforts to improve technical systems. Sankey diagrams can also be used to map value flows in systems at the operational level or along global value chains. The article charts the historical development of the diagrams. After the First World War the diagrams were used to produce thermal balances of production plants for glass and cement and to optimize the energy input. In the 1930s, steel and iron ore played a strategic role in Nazi Germany. Their efficient use was highlighted with Sankey diagrams. Since the 1990s, these diagrams have become common for displaying data in life cycle assessments (LCAs) of products. Sankey diagrams can also be used to map value flows in systems at the operational level or along global value added chains. This article, the first of a pair, charts the historical development. The companion article discusses the methodology and the implicit assumptions of such Sankey diagrams.},

A recent surge in reported cases of classical kernicterus, due in part to earlier hospital discharge and relaxation of treatment criteria for hyperbilirubinemia, and new reports of hyperbilirubinemia-induced auditory dysfunction using evoked potential based infant testing and hearing screening, underscore the need to better understand how hyperbilirubinemia causes brain damage in some infants, especially because the damage is preventable. Recent progress in understanding bilirubin binding and neurotoxicity resulting from unbound or "free" unconjugated bilirubin, how bilirubin affects the central nervous system in vivo and in vitro, and the use of new clinical tools in neonates, for example magnetic resonance imaging revealing bilateral lesions in globus pallidus and subthalamus, and abnormal brainstem auditory evoked potentials with normal inner ear function, may lead to improved detection and prevention of neurologic dysfunction and damage from bilirubin. Finally, the concern is raised that partial or isolated neurologic sequelae, for example auditory neuropathy and other central auditory processing disorders, may result from excessive amount and duration of exposure to free, unconjugated bilirubin at different stages of neurodevelopment.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The relapsing nature and varying geographical prevalence of ulcerative colitis (UC) implicates environmental factors such as diet in its aetiology.
METHODS: In order to determine which foods might be related to disease activity in UC a new method of dietary analysis was developed and applied. Eighty-one UC patients were recruited at all stages of the disease process. Following completion of a 7 d diet diary, clinical assessment including a sigmoidoscopic examination (scale 0 (normal mucosa) to 6 (very active disease)) was conducted. Food weights for each person were adjusted (divided) by the person's calorific intake for the week. Each food consumed was given a food sigmoidoscopy score (FSS) calculated by summing the products of the (adjusted) weight of food consumed and sigmoidoscopy score for each patient and occurrence of food and dividing by the total (adjusted) weight of the food consumed by all 81 patients. Thus, foods eaten in large quantities by patients with very active disease have high FSSs and vice versa. Foods consumed by \ensuremath{<}10 people or weighing \ensuremath{<}1 kg for the whole group were excluded, leaving 75 foods.
RESULTS: High FSS foods were characterized by high levels of the anti-thiamin additive sulfite (Mann-Whitney, p \ensuremath{<} 0.001), i.e. bitter, white wine, burgers, soft drinks from concentrates, sausages, lager and red wine. Caffeine also has anti-thiamin properties and decaffeinated coffee was associated with a better clinical state than the caffeine containing version. Beneficial foods (average intake per week) included pork (210 g), breakfast cereals (200 g), lettuce (110 g), apples and pears (390 g), milk (1250 ml), melon (350 g), bananas (350 g), bacon (120 g), beef and beef products (500 g), tomatoes (240 g), soup (700 g), citrus fruits (300 g), fish (290 g), yogurt (410 g), cheese (110 g), potatoes (710 g) and legumes (120 g).
CONCLUSIONS: The dietary analysis method described provides a new tool for establishing relationships between diet and disease and indicates a potentially therapeutic diet for UC.},

With these models the shape of the free surface and the extent of the surface of seepage are determined simultaneously with the potential distribution within the flow system. Four examples are given of the application of the method to the problem of the seepage of water through dams. In two cases the faces of the dams were assumed to be sloping, and in the others they were taken as vertical, the free surface and velocity distributions at the faces of one of the latter cases checking closely with those derived from an analytical solution of the problem. The method of applying these models to the study of more complex gravity flow systems is briefly indicated.},

  abstract = {The service-oriented approach has become more and more popular, now allowing highly integrated and yet heterogeneous applications. Web services are the natural evolution of conventional middleware technologies to support Web-based and enterprise-level integration.The highly dynamic characteristics of service-oriented applications means their validation is a continuous process that often runs in parallel with execution. It is not possible to clearly distinguish between the predeployment validation of a system and its use, nor is it possible to guarantee that the checks passed at a certain time will be passed at a later time and in the actual execution environment as well.Baresi and Di Nitto have put together the first reference on all aspects of testing and validating service-oriented architectures, taking into account these inherent intricacies. The contributions by leading academic and industrial research groups are structured into four parts on: static analysis to acquire insight into how the system is supposed to work; testing techniques to sample its actual behavior; monitoring to probe its operational performance; and nonfunctional requirements like reliability and trust.This monograph is an initial source of knowledge for researchers in both academia and industry in the field of service-oriented architecture validation and verification approaches. They will find a comprehensive survey of state-of-the-art approaches as well as techniques and tools to improve the quality of service-oriented applications.},

Serum (10�{[}mu{]}l) is added to 2.5�ml of DMSO solution containing zinc acetate (0.01�M) and Tris (0.2�M). After 60�min, at 37�C, the fluorescence is measured. The blank is obtained by mixing serum (10�{[}mu{]}l) and Tris-DMSO solution (2.5�ml) without zinc acetate. The method gave a linear calibration for 0.1-5�mg�dl-1 bilirubin, a 3.3{[}sigma{]} detection limit of 5�{[}mu{]}g�dl-1 and relative standard deviations for bilirubin in control sera of 1-2\% (n=10).

The approach is to provide a prescriptive approach to ecosystem design based upon ecological engineering principles and practices.

  abstract = {This paper provides a reference set of indices based on emergy, for the evaluation of ecotechnological processes and whole economies. Indices of emergy yield ratio (EYR), environmental loading ratio (ELR), and emergy investment ratio (EIR), among others, are stressed, and a new index the emergy sustainability index (ESI) is defined. The emergy indices for a given system are shown to be functions of renewable, nonrenewable and purchased emergy inflows. Indices are given for several ecological engineering activities including oil spill restoration, land reclamation and wastewater recycle through wetlands, several production systems, and several national economies to demonstrate their usefulness. Ecological engineering involves both natural and engineered systems and the flows of renewable and nonrenewable energy, the appropriate amounts of which are important to determine if they are to result in sustainable use of resources. The sustainability index can be used to evaluate appropriate nonrenewable investments in eco-technology to maximize their performance. Sustainability of economies is shown to be a function of the net yield of the economy and its `load' on the environment. The trends of these indices can be monitored over time and provide useful information about the dynamics of economic systems within the carrying capacity of the environment in which they develop. When a particular sector or production process is focused on, instead of a national economy, emergy based indices can provide insights into the thermodynamic efficiency of the process, the quality of its output, and the interaction between the process and its surrounding environment.},

This is accomplished by using an intermediate computation ``co-emergy'', and treating co-production as a problem of scale. In addition, we compare emergy calculations using inputs to the system with emergy calculations using what was used up in the system. It is shown that this can lead to slightly different results. We show how these methods can be used to compute emergy in systems at steady state, with imports and exports and with changes in stocks. These techniques allow direct comparison of competitive species, industries, or technologies using standard methods of linear algebra. It also enables us to include the efficiencies of various processes explicitly, which can help in the formulation and testing of conjectures about the relationships between emergy and local and system-wide efficiencies.},

  abstract = {Using bolus-enhanced CT, we encountered an unusual constellation of findings in seven patients with clinical evidence of right heart failure. These included retrograde hepatic venous opacification on the early bolus scans and a diffusely mottled pattern of hepatic enhancement seen only during the vascular phase of contrast administration. Ancillary CT findings include cardiomegaly, pleural effusions, ascites, and intrahepatic perivascular radiolucency. We believe that these CT abnormalities are caused by passive hepatic congestion. This pattern of abnormal hepatic enhancement represents a potential pitfall in the use of dynamic bolus-enhanced CT for the detection of focal hepatic masses. Recognition of passive hepatic congestion as a possible cause of mottled hepatic enhancement on CT may help explain clinical abnormalities of liver function in patients with heart failure and prevent confusion with other disease processes that produce abnormalities of hepatic attenuation.},

That is those Benefits which are never ever reducible to a simple monetary value, nonetheless they can always be object of a possible estimation, still in economic terms, by means of values understood as a "cipher".
The advantages of a Decision Making Process based on Ordinal Benefits (vs traditional economic benefits) will be shown with reference to the evaluation of well-calibrated Incentives concerning Hydrogen Fuel Cells, both under static and dynamic conditions. Such an evaluation criterion, which is preferentially based on the estimated external Benefits to be "remunerated" rather than on possible damages to be internalized, represents a valid reference guide for a Policy Maker. This precisely because it is always orientated toward the genesis of the Maximum Ordinality Excess.},

Accelerated C++'s uniquely modern approach will help you learn faster and more fluently than you ever believed possible. Based on the authors' intensive summer C++ courses at Stanford University, Accelerated C++ covers virtually every concept that most professional C++ programmers will ever use -- but it turns the "traditional" C++ curriculum upside down, starting with the high-level C++ data structures and algorithms that let you write robust programs immediately. Once you're getting results, Accelerated C++ takes you "under the hood," introducing complex language features such as memory management in context, and explaining exactly how and when to use them. From start to finish, the book concentrates on solving problems, rather than learning language and library features for their own sake. The result: You'll be writing real-world programs in no time -- and outstanding code faster than you ever imagined.},

  abstract = {The recent development of Google Earth, an information service that provides imagery and three-dimensional data depicting the entire Earth, provides an opportunity to use a new method of navigating information to save energy in the real world. Google Earth uses Keyhole Markup Language (KML) for modeling and storing geographic features and information for display in the Google Earth Client. This paper will analyze the potential of this novel and free geographic mapping service to reduce embodied energy of transportation in two ways. First, at the consumer level, Google Earth will be studied to map the automobile route that uses the least fuel and maintains vehicle velocities at their individual maximum fuel efficiency. The same analysis for single destination trips could be used to optimize fleet vehicle routes such as garbage or recycling collection trucks. The secondary benefit of ecological education will also be explored. Fuel used could be converted into monetary units based on the current price of gas, pollution/greenhouse gas emissions, or ecological footprints to improve driving habits. Secondly, KML overlays will be analyzed for use of determining: (i) raw material and products availability as a function of location, and (ii) modes of transportation as a function of emissions. These overlays would enable manufacturers access to an easily navigable method to optimize the life cycle of their products by minimizing embodied energy of transportation. The most efficient transportation methods and travel routes could be calculated. This same tool would be useful for architects to obtain Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design rating points for the green design of buildings. Overall, the analysis completed finds that the flexibility and visual display of quantitative information made available by Google Earth could have a significant impact at conserving fuel resources by reducing the embodied energy of transportation on a global scale.},

  abstract = {A dissolved oxygen sensor based on the quenching of fluorescence from a ruthenium dye complex entrapped in a porous sol-gel film is reported. Sol-gel-derived silica films were fabricated by dip-coating on to planar and optical fibre substrates. The films were pre-doped with the oxygen-sensitive ruthenium complex {[}RII-tris(4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline){]}, the fluorescence of which is quenched in the presence of oxygen. The structure and behaviour of sol-gel films are dependent on the fabrication parameters. In particular, enhancement of the surface hydrophobicity increases the quenching response in water. This is achieved by using suitable proportions of modified precursors of silica of the form R(OEt)3Si, where R is an alkyl group, in the standard fabrication procedure. It is shown that by increasing the ratio of modified precursor, the quenching response in the aqueous phase increases. A very low limit of detection, 6 ppb, was determined for the modified films. Using a high-brightness blue LED, combined with a miniature photodiode detection system, these results indicate the potential for a low-cost, high-performance, portable dissolved oxygen sensor for use in many varied situations from aeration control to on-line river pollution monitoring.},

  abstract = {Efficiency forms the bedrock of policy, planning and business approaches to sustainable development. But what do ecological economists mean by efficiency? In the resource use context, efficiency has a wide range of potential interpretations, from the ratio of work output/energy inputs to Pareto efficiency. Despite the potential richness of the efficiency concept, in practice, efficiency is often narrowly conceived within disciplinary boundaries. This appears to be the case even in ecological economics, which purports to be `transdisciplinary' and pluralistic. Such narrow disciplinary perspectives essentially waste the richness of the efficiency concept. This wasting could mean ecological economists and decision-makers are destined to Sisyphean toil in the pursuit of sustainable development.

This paper explores the efficiency concept and its interpretation. It then reviews ecological economic literature to find that there is much room for improvement in the way ecological economists apply efficiency. Finally, the paper presents a framework within which a truly ecological economic approach to efficiency can emerge. Armed with this framework, policy makers and planners should be better prepared to make decisions leading to sustainable development.},

Focussing on issues of origins, theories, parallels and potential, the discussions place issues in a broad context, compare and contrast central concepts with those of the Gaia hypothesis, sustainability and global change, and examine the potential application of noospheric ideas to current debates about culture, education and technology in such realms as the Internet, space exploration, and the emergence of super-consciousness. Literally the sphere of mind or intellect', the noosphere is aprt of the realm of the possible' in human affairs, where there is a conscious effort to tackle global issues The noosphere concept captures a number of key contemporary issues - social evolution, global ecology, Gaia, deep ecology and global environmental change - contributing to ongoing debates concerning the implications of emerging technologies.},

  abstract = {The production of energy from unconventional sources of fossil fuels, (e.g., tar sands, shale or sandstone formations where oil or natural gas is tightly bound), is forming an increasingly large proportion of global energy use. This research evaluates three of the most prominent emerging methods of fossil fuel production{\textemdash}oil from oil/tar sands, shale oil and shale gas, both produced through hydraulic fracturing. In 2013, 42\% of natural gas production and 41\% of oil production in the United States was produced through hydraulic fracturing and \ensuremath{\sim}60\% of new oil and gas wells use the method. In 2013, the Alberta region of Canada produced 1.7 million barrels per day of synthetic crude oil from oil sands, exporting 1.3 million barrels to the US every day, comprising \ensuremath{\sim}7\% of daily US oil consumption. Results from this work show that natural gas obtained through hydraulic fracturing has an emergy yield ratio (EYR) between 4.23 and 9.18, depending on well productivity and whether the gas is ``wet'' (contains other hydrocarbons) or ``dry'' (pure or nearly pure methane). Synthetic crude oil from oil sands was found to have an EYR of 3.38{\textendash}4.06 (in situ vs. mined production, respectively). The EYR of tight oil was found to be 3.43{\textendash}4.73, dependent on the productivity of the well. Given the relatively high current market price of oil and relatively low market price of natural gas the observed results (i.e., similar or higher EYR for natural gas than past observations and a lower EYR for oil than past observations) are expected.},

  abstract = {This paper provides a concise overview of the influence of human activity within the UK society on resource consumption and the subsequent effects on the environment. The concept of the multi-scale integrated analysis of societal metabolism is applied to elucidate the evolution of the UK economy for the period between 1981 and 2004. Our findings highlight the transition to a service-based economy and the disproportionate increase of energy demand when compared to the overall population increase. Emergy synthesis is applied in order to understand the production and consumption patterns and the environmental support required to sustain human activity within the UK for the year 2004. Generally speaking the UK society greatly benefits from its significant natural resources with 44.3\% of the total emergy used coming from home sources and 29.1\% from locally renewable sources. Interestingly enough, despite its significant natural resources, the UK economy, seems to be a net emergy importer by 638.5�נ1021�seJ. Furthermore, the current economic activity is believed to have a significant impact in the environment despite the relatively low environmental load ratio of 2.44.},

  abstract = {China is the largest rice producing and consuming country in the world, but rice production has given way to the production of vegetables during the past twenty years. The government has been trying to stop this land-use conversion and increase the area in rice-vegetable rotation. Important questions that must be answered to determine what strategy is best for society are, "What is the reason behind this conversion?"; "Which system is more productive and which is more sustainable?"; and "How can economic policy be used to adjust the pattern of farmland use to attain sustainable development?" To answer these questions, a combined evaluation of these agricultural production systems was done using emergy, energy and economic methods. An economic analysis clearly showed that the reason for this conversion was simply that the economic output/input ratio and the benefit density of the vegetable production system were greater than that of rice. However, both energy and emergy evaluations showed that long-term rice was the best choice for sustainable development, followed by rotation systems. The current price of rice is lower than the em-value of rice produced from the long-term rice system, but higher than that of rice produced from the rotation system. Scenario analysis showed that if the government increases the price of rice to the em-value of rice produced from the long-term rice system, US\$0.4/kg, and takes the value of soil organic matter into account, the economic output/input ratios of both the rice and rotation systems will be higher than that of the vegetable system. The three methods, energy, emergy and economics, are different but complementary, each revealing a different aspect of the same system. Their combined use shows not only the reasons behind a system's current state or condition, but also the way to adjust these systems to move toward more sustainable states.},

Two diagramming methods�-�causal loop diagrams (CLDs) and stock/flow diagrams (SFDs)�-�are then described and their advantages and limitations discussed. A set of broad research directions is then outlined. These concern: the abilities of different diagrams to communicate different ideas, the role that diagrams have in group model building, and the question of whether diagrams can be an adequate substitute for simulation modelling. The paper closes by suggesting that although diagrams alone are insufficient, they have many benefits. However, since these benefits have emerged only as lsquocraft wisdomrsquo, a more rigorous programme of research into the diagrams' respective attributes is called for.

  title = {Pulsing and self-organization},
  url = {http://search.proquest.com/docview/304425129?accountid=13552},
  abstract = {This dissertation investigated systems designs to account for the pulsing paradigm, a general systems concept, that states that self-organization increases performance by accumulating storages, which are transferred to a higher consumer level in the energy hierarchy and fed back in sharp repeating pulses. Similar pulsing patterns were found in published data from many fields, and graphical analyses were made of published time series of plankton data of limnology and oceanography. Although the data appeared to be noisy and irregular, pulse amplitude was proportional to the time interval between pulses of similar size. Small-scale pulses were more frequent. Larger scale pulses delivered their effects in shorter time periods relative to their intervals. Such patterns may be explained as the result of simultaneous pulsing on several scales.                 After review of simulation models by other investigators, alternative systems designs were simulated including a single simple producer-consumer-recycle model and compound combinations. Designs which generated time series like those observed in many fields were analyzed for their energy characteristics.                 Simulation of the emergy (spelled with an "m"; the available energy of one kind required to make a product) flows and storages showed pulses to be high transformity, a hypothetical measure of feedback impact. Whereas the model with a single pulsing pair unit (e.g. consumer-resource unit) did not generate pulsing patterns when energy input was very low or very high, compound designs allowed excess input energy to be routed to the productivity of other pulsing units. The model with two producer-consumer-recycle units connected in parallel pulsed over a wide range of input energy levels and efficiencies. A hierarchy of pulses of different frequency was obtained when producer-consumer-recycle models were connected in series, with more frequent pulses in lower energy levels. The pulsing producer-consumer unit drew more power than a non-pulsing producer-consumer unit with similar calibrations. The theory that self-organization selects pulsing which increases performance of complex systems was compared with other theories for pulsing in various fields including economics and earth science.                 The pulsing paradigm explains fluctuations observed in systems as the concurrent dynamic pulsing on many scales.},

  abstract = {Microglia are the resident immune cells of the brain and are the principal source of cytokines produced during central nervous system inflammation. We have previously shown that increased levels of unconjugated bilirubin (UCB), which can be detrimental to the central nervous system during neonatal life, induce the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and glutamate by astrocytes. Nevertheless, the effect of UCB on microglia has never been investigated. Hence, the main goal of the present study was to evaluate whether UCB leads to microglial activation and to the release of the cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, and IL-6. Additionally, we investigated the effects of UCB on glutamate efflux and cell death. The results showed that UCB induces morphological changes characteristic of activated microglia and the release of high levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, UCB triggered extracellular accumulation of glutamate and an increased cell death by apoptosis and necrosis. These results demonstrate, for the first time, that UCB is toxic to microglial cells and point to microglia as an important target of UCB in the central nervous system. Moreover, they suggest that UCB-induced cytokine production, by mediating cell injury, can further contribute to exacerbate neurototoxicity. Interestingly, microglia cells are much more responsive to UCB than astrocytes. Collectively, these data indicate that microglia may play an important role in the pathogenesis of encephalopathy during severe hyperbilirubinemia. � 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {This paper provides a historical perspective for the discussion on ecological economics as a special field of research. By studying the historical background of ecological economics, the present discussions and tensions inside the field might become easier to understand and to relate to. The study is inspired by other studies of the emergence of new research areas done by sociologists and historians of science, and includes both cognitive and social aspects, macro trends and the role of individuals. The basis for the paper is a combination of literature studies and interviews with key researchers from the field. The story opens with the emergence of the new environmental agenda in the 1960s, which was influenced by the scientific development in biology and ecology. Then it is outlined how the environmental challenge was met by economics in the 1960s. Around 1970, the basic ideas of ecological economics were given modern formulations, but it took a long gestation period from the beginning of the 1970s to the end of the 1980s, before ecological economics took shape. During this gestation period, the personal relationships between the actors were formed, and the meetings that were decisive for the formal establishment of ecological economics took place.},

  abstract = {The maximum power principle is a potential guide to understanding the patterns and processes of ecosystem development and sustainability. The principle predicts the selective persistence of ecosystem designs that capture a previously untapped energy source. This hypothesis was investigated empirically in controlled and replicated tests conducted in planktonic microcosms. Microecosystems that developed under a pH-controlled light regime, in which light duration was altered based on changes in an ecosystem-controllable variable (water column pH), were compared with those that developed under fixed photoperiods. According to the principle, pH-decreasing (and power-increasing) organization should selectively persist under pH-controlled light. To assess changes in pH dynamics that occurred under the alternative selection regime, in which photoperiods were not linked with pH-affecting selection or organization, the microecosystems that developed under fixed photoperiods were subjected to pH-controlled light on the last day of each test. The daily light duration increased 506�min on average in microecosystems that developed under pH-controlled light and 412�min on average in microecosystems that developed under fixed photoperiods. Selective reinforcement of acid-secreting blue-green algae in response to CO2 and nutrient limitations could account for the greater increase in power acquisition in microecosystems that developed under pH-controlled light.},

  abstract = {Although the Aminco-Bowman spectrophotofluorometer is widely employed as an analytical tool, relatively few users of the instrument seem to be familiar with its basic optical features. As a result, optimal performance of the apparatus is frequently not obtained, although it can be adapted to a wide range of fluorescence measurements including corrected excitation and emission spectra, quantum yields, polarization of fluorescence, as well as simple measurements of fluorescence intensity. Increasing interest in emission spectroscopy in recent years has generated a demand for more sophistication in the use of instruments for measuring fluorescence. Fortunately, coincident with these requirements, there have been marked improvements in the stability of lamp sources and in the quality of optical components. It does not seem unreasonable, therefore, that commercially available fluorescence spectrometers may be used for purposes other than the simple measurements for which they were originally intended. The present paper discusses some practical aspects of the use of the Aminco-Bowman spectrophotofluorometer for accurate measurement of spectra in the hope that such a communication will be helpful to those who wish to extend the usefulness of the instrument.},

  abstract = {The traditional Differential Calculus often shows its limits when describing living systems. These in fact present such a richness of characteristics that are, in the majority of cases, much wider than the description capabilities of the usual differential equations. Such an aspect became particularly evident during the research (completed in 2001) for an appropriate formulation of Odum's Maximum Em-Power Principle (proposed by the Author as a possible Fourth Thermodynamic Principle). In fact, in such a context, the particular non-conservative Algebra, adopted to account for both Quality and quantity of generative processes, suggested we introduce a faithfully corresponding concept of ``derivative'' (of both integer and fractional order) to describe dynamic conditions however variable. The new concept not only succeeded in pointing out the corresponding differential bases of all the rules of Emergy Algebra, but also represented the preferential guide in order to recognize the most profound physical nature of the basic processes which mostly characterize self-organizing Systems (co-production, co-injection, inter-action, feed-back, splits, etc.). From a mathematical point of view, the most important novelties introduced by such a new approach are: (i) the derivative of any integer or fractional order can be obtained independently from the evaluation of its lower order derivatives; (ii) the exponential function plays an extremely hinge role, much more marked than in the case of traditional differential equations; (iii) wide classes of differential equations, traditionally considered as being non-linear, become ``intrinsically'' linear when reconsidered in terms of ``incipient'' derivatives; (iv) their corresponding explicit solutions can be given in terms of new classes of functions (such as ``binary'' and ``duet'' functions); (v) every solution shows a sort of ``persistence of form'' when representing the product generated with respect to the agents of the generating process; (iv) and, at the same time, an intrinsic ``genetic'' ordinality which reflects the fact that any product ``generated'' is something more than the sum of the generating elements. Consequently all these properties enable us to follow the evolution of the ``product'' of any generative process from the very beginning, in its ``rising'', in its ``incipient'' act of being born. This is why the new ``operator'' introduced, specifically apt when describing the above-mentioned aspects, was termed as ``incipient'' (or ``spring'') derivative. In addition, even if the considered approach was suggested by the analysis of self-organizing living Systems, some specific examples of non-living Systems will also be mentioned. In fact, what is much more surprising is that such an approach is even more valid (than the traditional one) to describe non-living Systems too. In fact the resulting ``drift'' between traditional solutions and ``incipient'' solutions led us to reconsider the phenomenon of Mercury's precessions. The satisfactory agreement with the astronomical data suggested, as a consequential hypothesis, a different interpretation of its physical origin, substantially based on the Maximum Em-Power Principle.},

  abstract = {This study was targeted at finding one or more environmentally efficient, economically feasible and ecologically sustainable bioremediation treatment modes for eutrophic water. Three biological species, i.e. water spinach (Ipomoea aquatica), loach (Misgurus anguillicaudatus) and a pseudomonad (Rhodopseudomonas palustris), were combined in different ways: (A) water spinach{\textendash}loach{\textendash}pseudomonad; (B) water spinach{\textendash}loach; (C) water spinach{\textendash}pseudomonad, to construct three ecological engineering systems targeted at removing nutrients from the eutrophic water of Taihu Lake, PR China. An integrated water quality, emergy and economic evaluation of the three treatment systems was performed based on the observed changes in biomass, water quality, and other natural and economic inputs and outputs. The three ecological engineering treatment systems showed a different order of efficiency in removing nutrients (treatment A \&gt; B \&gt; C), produced different environmental loadings at the foreground (treatment B \&gt; C \&gt; A), background (treatment C = A \&gt; B) and whole system scales (treatment C \&gt; A \&gt; B), and had different economic feasibility (treatment B \&gt; A \&gt; C). Finally, after taking all direct and indirect environmental and economic impacts into account, treatment A was found to be the best choice at the foreground scale, followed by treatment C and then B, while at the background and whole system scales, treatment B was the best option followed by A and C. In this analysis, emergy evaluation was found to be an ideal ecological integration tool for quantifying both the environmental and economic characteristics of ecological engineering systems and processes at multiple scales, including pollution treatment systems. The complex results of this study obtained by considering water treatment efficiency, emergy indices of sustainability and loading on multiple scales besides economic output/input analysis can inform decision-makers about trade-offs that confront them in the management of eutrophic waters.},

  abstract = {This invention is comprised of an end effector for use in probing a surface with a robotic arm. The end effector has a first portion that carries a gamble with a probe, the gamble holding the probe normal to the surface, and a second portion with a set of three shafts within a housing for urging the gamble and probe against the surface. The second portion contains a potentiometer connected by another shaft to the first portion to measure the position of the first portion with respect to the second so that the second portion can be moved to place and maintain the shafts at the midpoint of their travel. Then, as irregularities in the surface are encountered, the first portion can respond by moving closer to or farther from the second portion.},

  abstract = {The theory that water resources can be evaluated by their embodied energy is applied to examples. The energy effect of water is calculated as the energy flow of one type it produces in a specific use. Energy analysis is applied as an inclusive overview method for managing land and water resources. The analysis employs the conceptual tools of energy quality, embodied energy, and energy amplifer effect. A simple land-use model representative of the major land-use systems is formulated. The theory of selection for maximum power is applied and coupled with linear programming techniques to suggest an optimal method determining best use of water for combined economics of humanity and nature. The objective function is structured in terms of the total energy productivity of all the subsystems. The maximum power principle is employed as a more inclusive criterion than the usual profit or utility maximization. In the example applied to Lee County, Florida, the results are within the range of its current land distribution. 24 references, 10 figures.},

In choosing the ingredients for this medium, the goal was to emphasize properties that influence interactions of human semen with topical contraceptive, prophylactic, or therapeutic products. Among these properties, pH and buffering capacity, osmolarity, ionic strength, and rheological properties play dominant roles in the physico-chemical processes that govern drug release kinetics and delivery vehicle distribution.},

  abstract = {Exergy based analyses are considered by the scientific community appropriate tools for the design and the performance evaluation and improvements of energy systems. Moreover, they are today recognized as proper instruments to assess economic, environmental and social externalities of energy systems. This paper presents the results of a study in which different exergy analysis methods are adopted to determine the optimal design configuration of a gas turbine operating in simple Joule Brayton cycle.

Standard exergy and Thermoeconomic analyses are performed to identify the highest thermodynamic efficiency and minimum economic cost configurations of the system, while for the environmental analysis Authors propose an innovative method in which the exergy analysis is combined with a Risk Analysis. With this method the total risk associated to the system is used as objective function in the same way as monetary cost is for standard Thermoeconomic analysis. These three methods aims therefore to determine the optimal design configurations of the system with respect to their specific objective functions, respectively: exergy cost (J/J), monetary (exergoeconomic) cost ({\mbox{\texteuro}}/J) and risk (injured/J) of the product.

Results lead to three different optimal design parameters for the system, according to the objective of each analysis procedure.},

# Preface

This PhD began with technical motivations to: 

```
1. Bring together a number of different technologies and databases that store water data
2. Generate services which value add to those technologies

```
The latter of these motivations implied a review of the current literature with respects to risk and governance, together with the analysis and generation of novel services such as providing risking of assets associated with unconventional energy resources such as Coal Seam Gas production (CGS).

Notwithstanding any emergent gaps or requirements emanating from the literature review, the default methodological goals are:

```
* A method for integrating uncertainty into a risk assessment 
* A method for turning risk & reliability into timeseries - dynamic risk 
* A method for assessing 'risk density'

```

Notwithstanding any emergent gaps or requirements emanating from the technical review, the default technical goals are:

```
* BigData (MongoDB) integration of different data models of Hydstra & GWDB together with WQ data
* Mobile app for form novel data acquisition
* Visualisation and analysis with D3.js and GeoJSON-like technologies.

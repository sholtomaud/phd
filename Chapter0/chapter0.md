# Preface

## Motivations

This PhD began with technical motivations to: 

1. Bring together a number of different technologies and databases that store water data for value-add services.

2. Generate such value-add services which enable visualisation, data collection, tranfer and ultimately governance at a level not currently possible

The latter of these motivations aimed to generate services that are relevant to risk governance of assets associated with unconventional energy resources like Coal Seam Gas production (CGS) and groundwater systems potentially impacted by these resources.

## Lit Review

All of these motivations are to be summarized in a literature review which would be the launching pad for subsequent articles.
		
## Methods & Models

Notwithstanding any emergent gaps or requirements emanating from the literature review, the default methodological goals are:

* A method for schema integration, merging many different databases into one BigData solution 
* A method for turning risk & reliability into timeseries - dynamic risk 
** socail / compliance / technical / financial / hedgebook
** visualisation in 2D/3D
* A model for risk governance

## Articles
These goals are addressed in separate articles which are documented below as a part of this thesis. In terms of main articles I see the following outputs:

* A system for integrating disparate hydrological data models using big data 
* Visualisation of risk as a timeseries {subtitle}
* Risk governance and management systems {subtitle}

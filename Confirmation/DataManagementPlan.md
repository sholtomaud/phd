# Data Management Plan

All data collected in use for the project is already available to the public through the Queensland Government's Open Data program. 

* There will be no confidential data collected, used or produced during the research. 
* There will be no data used that is not already available in the public domain 
* There will be no value-add to any data for use in a production environment 

Fresh copies of any data will be obtained and overwritten periodically throughout the testing phase of the system.

# Preface

This PhD began with technical motivations to: 

```
1. Bring together a number of different technologies and databases that store water data
2. Generate services which value add to those technologies

```
The latter of these motivations aimed to generate services that are relevant to risk governance of assets associated with unconventional energy resources like Coal Seam Gas production (CGS) and groundwater systems potentially impacted by these resources.

Notwithstanding any emergent gaps or requirements emanating from the literature review, the default methodological goals are:

```
* A method for integrating many different databases into one solution 
* A method for turning risk & reliability into timeseries - dynamic risk 
* A method for establishing risk governance

```

These goals are addressed in separate articles which are documented below as a part of this thesis.

# Abstract

This review aims to identify the appropriate requirements for an unconventional energy production risk management framework, where the asset at risk is groundwater. It covers the current legislative approaches to the management of risk within the recent Australian experience of Coal Seam Gas. 

# Introduction

In the last few years unconventional energy (UE) production has been considered a significant potential economic resource for Australia. Unconventional energy in the Australian context, generally refers to gas held in shale or coal formations, along with what is known as "tight gas" [@Taylor2012, p.7]. 

As noted by Professor Martin in the Committee for Economic Development of Australia (CEDA) report, property rights and water management are key issues for unconventional energy production [@Taylor2012, p.5]. For water management specifically, Martin recommended that; 

* Water allocation and licensing frameworks needed to be enhanced to include water that is produced, and consumed by UE producers 
* Due to the potential for irreversible damage to environmental systems, including hydrological systems, UE producers develop a robust risk management framework with strong precautionary principles 

These views, and the support for a National approach to a Risk management framework appear to have broad support and are shared with the water industry [@Beckers2013, @Howe2010, @Hunter2013]. In Australia this momentum has culminated in the National Harmonsied Regulatory Framework [@SCER2013].

In addressing the Queensland context the Harmonisation Framework says "This policy focuses on the management and use of produced water under the EP Act, and does not vary the requirements of the Water Act, such as ‘making good’ any relevant impacts on water bores that may result from an operation to extract natural gas from coals seams."

The interest in this review is where the rubber hits the road, and the proverbial "devil in the details". This is to say, that at a high level the requirement for a robust risk management framework is not in dispute. However the implementation at the technical level presents difficulties. The author of this review was 'at the coal face', so to speak, during the attempt to implement such systems, and so the interest here is in reviewing the lower level system requirements generated from the higher level requirement of developing a robust risk management framework. 




It is anticipated that in conducting this review, gaps and technical requirements will be generated, and these will become the proposed subject of future research effort.
To contextualise these requirements further, the concepts risk, risk management framework, make good and liability will be addressed.


# Risk

The concept of risk can hold different significance depending on world view. Risk can be acceptable or unacceptable, and the risk of an even for one person can outweigh any potential gains from that event as seen in the eyes of another person.

The purpose of this review is to identify some of the different types of Risks, and types of Risk Analysis methods used in industries relevant to CSG and Groundwater.

In general, most observers would be happy with the notion that Risk is a spectrum. Any particular event might be classed anywhere between low or negligible risk, and high risk, or catastrophic. When an event is contentious it is generally the evaluation or perception of the risk methodology used which is at moot.

In the eye of the stakeholder, the risk methodology might be;

* sound, but not well communicated
* unsound, and not well communicated
* sound, and well communicated
* unsound, and well communicated




## Risk Analysis & Assessment


The field of Risk Assessment is broad, however two general approaches have been recogonised as quantitative and qualitative. Within both of these two approaches 
the standard generic calculation of Risk (R) is through the product of the Probability of some event X (P(X)) and the Consequence (C) of that event occurring.

\[
  \mathit{R} = \mathit{P}(\mathit{X}) \bullet \mathit{C} \label{ref1}
\]


### Qualitative Risk Assessment

Qualitative assessments of risk are based on expert opinion. Risk is assigned in relative terms based on the expert's estimation. Risk is described as low-high, and the assignment of the consequence a best estimate. Baker et al. note that this method of assessment is inclined to be subjective and so suggest that they may lead to inconsistencies and non-repeatable outcomes [@Baker1998]. 

#### Connectivity Risk Assessment 

An example of a qualitative assessment of risk is the Spring Connectivity risk assessment contained in the Underground Water Impact Report (UWIR). The UWIR was generated by the Queensland State Water Commission in a multi-party spring management workshop with botanists, ecologists, spring experts, researchers, petroleum tenure holders and State and Commonwealth Government  [@QWC2012, p.78].

### Quantitative Risk Assessment

#### Risk and Reliability in Hydrosystems and Water Engineering

In hydsrosystems and water resource engineering, reliability is commonly introduced in the discussion of risk, specifically with reference to dams [@Goodarzi2013, @Mays2010]. Here, the same initial hazard identification step is undertaken as with the qualitative analysis given above. The next step is to introduce and quantify the probability of the risk.

Resistance (*r*) and load (*l*) are two central concepts to the definition of risk and reliability in this context. ^[Mays notes that structural engineers might be more familiar with the concepts of *strength* and *stress* respectively.] Resistance is defined as the ability of a system component to meet it's designed purpose without failure when subjected to an external load. Load might be a mechanical or other forcing stress.
 
In this context, risk is then defined as the probability of the load exceeding the resistance - the probability of failure. Reliability is the inverse. That is, the probability of the resistance exceeding the load - the probability of survival [@Mays2010, p.387].

Where $\mathit{r}$ = resistance and $\mathit{l}$ = load, reliability ( $\mathit{R}$ ) is then defined as: 

\[
  \mathit{R} = \mathit{P}( \mathit{r} > \mathit{l} ) = \mathit{P}( \mathit{r} - \mathit{l} > 0 ) 
\]

And risk $\mathit{ \bar{R} }$, is then defined as:

\[
  \mathit{\bar{R}} = 1 - \mathit{R}
\]

{{ Uncertainty & Probability etc. }}


Mays, gave a water storage, as a problem for calculating the reliability of supply [-@Mays2010, Fig.10.7.3, p.390]. This example renders the force of a water tank $(\mathit{Q})$, as the source of resistance, and a tap as a source of load.  

![Mays2010 Fig10.7.3](./../../images/Mays2010_Fig10_7_3_p390.png)

Uncertainty in roughness is assumed to make the supply to the user uncertain. Roughness is incorrectly applied a measure of pipe failure in this instance. This curious example, whilst making mathematical sense, is a little contrived since there are no fail conditions. Under conditions where piping, tank and tap don't fail, the supply will always meet demand when a tap is turned on, unless the tank is dry. 

Translate into Odum flow: Qs = kQ = Q*1/RC

### Environmental Risk

The concepts of load and resistance as used in risk and reliability calculations were introduced above [@Goodarzi2013, @Mays2010]. Whilst Goodarzi et al applied these concepts in hydrosystems, they are not typically applied to ecology or biology. 
de Guenni [@deGuenni2012] introduce a quantitative definition of Environmental Risk 

\[

  \mathit{\bar{R}_{residual}} = \mathit{\bar{R}_{v}} \bullet \mathit{\bar{R}_{t}} \bullet \mathit{\bar{R}_{\neg CM}} 

\]

de Guenni then moves on to quantify the expected cost of loss (*ECL*). 

\[

  \mathit{ECL} = \mathit{\bar{R}_{final}} \bullet \mathit{C}_$
\]

Should there be a further integrate of the hydrosystems approach of using load and resistance with the environmetrics approach shown by de Guenni? 

Li, evaluated ecosystem risk with similar method, defining reliability of an  ecosystem as the probability of the water resources of the
oasis to yield a supply greater than the need. We denote it
by the equation as follows:

\[
  \mathit{R} = \mathit{P}(\mathit{X}_t)
\]

 however not using the language of load and resistance [@LI2007]. 


#### Environmental Resistance

An integration of traditional hydrosystems/water engineering risk analysis methods with ecological methods might be achieved by applying the concepts of load and resistance in biology & ecology. Chapman represented the environment as resistance to "biotic potential", measured as the difference between potential organism population - "biotic potential" - and actual population [@Chapman1931, p.194].

Chapman noted that this approach was analogous to the methods of Fourier and Ohm with the resistances of 1) heat transmission through a solid and 2) electric current transmission through a system respectively [Ibid.]. Chapman suggested a generalisation of Ohm's law from electrical circuits could applied applicable in ecology, where resistance is defined as the resistance offered to an unvarying current by a standard-unit circuit [Ibid.]. 

If the Chapman's uses of load and resistance might be

One novel linkage is through the concept of environmental (or ecological) resistance. Ecologists and biologists have  



## Bridging the gap and creating another

As noted above, qualitative risk assessments like that done for Spring Connectivity in the UWIR, have difficulty of reproducibility, and typically do not lead to a quantified consequence in dollar terms. The question about whether or not there is effort required to bridge this gap, or whether or not the qualitative risk assessment is adequate.

In terms of the argument for a closer integration, as was also noted above, if there is no connection between the ecosystems dependent on a bore and the risk of any event associated with a bore, then the *de facto* make good risk is pegged to the bore license value for UTC calculations. Hence, the ecosystem value of the bore does not enter the risk calculation.

What is required is the 



The recent concept of ecosystems services, has come some way to address this gap.  


"The embodied energy of the environmental system, such as marsh
(storage and annual flow), is the basis for attracting economic
activity, which is competitive so long as the ratio of free embodied
energy embodied in purchased inputs (goods, services, fuels) is
greater than that of competitors"





In the case of ecology, one approach originally suggested by systems ecologist H.T.Odum [^1] was to put a dollar value on ecosystem services [@Odum1971, @Odum1979a, @Odum1981, @Odum1987, @Odum1994, @Odum1995, @Odum2000]. As Lansing notes [-@Lansing1998], this was a controversial attempt to create a common framework for ecology - broadly understood to include hydrological circuits - and economics within the field of thermodynamics and analog electric circuits. 

Whilst the analogical method was well established in rocket science and engineering [@Olson1958, @Cohen1963, @Fifer1961, @Norris1966, @Phillips1969, @Sinkoff, @Stallman1963, @Tomayko1985, @Truitt1960, @Walton1963, @West1957], it was argued by Taylor and others that the same method was not appropriate for large scale systems such as economic and ecological systems [@Taylor1988, @Taylor1991].

Perhaps due to this continuing controversy surrounding Odum's work, the approach has not been applied in any meaningful way in risk analysis. However there are linkages which can be retrieved from the literature.






[^1]: 
  Interestingly, Odum was apparently shocked that tar sands and shale gas were touted as energetically viable replacements for conventional energy resources. "Exploiting profit-positive but negative net-energy deposits, burns energy, destroys the boreal ecosystems, drains aquifers, and increases global heating. My father never believed that we would be so stupid." [M.Odum, cited in @Weyler2011].




## The Load, Resistance and Liability
















### Quantitative Risk Assessment

Quantitative techniques are normally mathematically and/or computationally based [@Baker1998].



## Risk management frameworks

In the Terms of Reference for Activity 5 of the CSG Feasibility Study, a hybrid Groundwater Model and Multi Criteria Analysis (GMMCA) risk assessment methodology was developed [@Beckers2013].





## What is a risk management framework?





## Frameworks

In order for the framework to achieve these goals, it is important that it provides
comprehensive references to the scientific information and data framework it intends on
using, or indeed any scientific information it has consulted. Demonstrable scientific
underpinning will assist in community and industry education, and improvement in
developing and implementing leading practices [@Hunter2013]. 

practical steps to measure, share and analyse environmental data across
jurisdictions [@ANEDO2013]. 


As noted in the Harmonisation Framework, QLD applies an adaptive management approach. In this approach, defined trigger thresholds are used to initiate the make-good process [@SCER2013, p.47]. 





## Strict Liability

With reference to the two recommendations made above, Taylor [Ibid] went on to suggest that where UE producers use water resources, they should carry the costs associated with any impacts from activities. This view concurs with the views of landholders, who wish to receive appropriate compensation and payments [@VFF2013, ]. 


Strict liability is the imposition of liability on a party without a finding of fault. The question is whether UE producers have  would therefore be afforded to the tortfeasor. 




In this context the NWC recommended that that bonds and sureties should deal with uncertainty and the timeframes associated with potential impacts [@NWC2010]. As the NWC noted, these time frames may potentially extend past 100 years, which is well-beyond the expected life-span of the CSG recovery process.




"This includes impacts such as long-term reductions in adjacent aquifer
 pressures and levels, and impacts on environmental assets that are not adequately
 protected by current ‘make good’ mechanisms" [@NWC2010].



"risk assessment model must include a
definition of ‘unacceptable impacts’ to the environment and human health and
any projects falling in this category should not be allowed to proceed. Risk
assessment should not be undertaken by the proponent but by an independent
third party."  ... “Verification of key system elements” should not rely on appraisal by “in house
representatives” but rather only “independent third-party professional[s]”. [@Boudicca2013]




## Connection between Risk, Liability and Make Good




### Cumulative Effects



 As noted by the National Water Comission (NWC), in the context of groundwater, these costs may have the potential to persist beyond the life cycle of the UE production  


 This raises concern over the temporal extent of liability. The tort "civil wrong"


 The term "cumulative effect" is used to conceptualise this temporal extent of liability. 

Cumulative effects are effects that are successive or incremental over time [@Howe2010]. Whilst Taylor's discussion was framed within the context of negative effects, the concept of cumulative effect was designed not to have pejorative content, but to recognise that cumulative effects on society, the economy and the environment can be conceived as either positive or negative, or a combination of the two at any one time. 

In a legal context, this raises the question of whether such cumulative effects are held as unavoidable, or whether liability is *res ipsa loquitur*: That is, where negligence is attributed by the evidence of cumulative impact, rather than by breach of duty [@Schremmer2011]. 

The resolution of this question has legal consequence in the calculation of risk, and in the perceived risk, since the granting the status of unavoidable, would appear to reduce liability claims by the plaintiff, and the associated risk of the operation. 





The notion of scaling precautionary or corrective (so-called "make good") actions in response to information is encompassed in the concept of Adaptive Environmental Management (AEM). In the context of groundwater a Groundwater Model Multi Criteria Analysis (GMMCA) was proposed as an enhanced a Multi Criteria Analysis (MCA) designed to incorporate geological, hydrological, environmental and economic attributes within the AEM paradigm [@Beckers2013]. Both the GMMCA, and the concept of scaling precaution have the intent to enable regulatory flexibility, and to refine and improve risk mapping over time [@Beckers2013]. 



For Taylor precautionary measures be scaled according to information available about impacts [@Taylor2012, p.11]. As a part of this flexibility, Beckers et al recommend that adaptive methodologies include the temporal aspect within risk assessment [@Beckers2013, p.iii], with the ability to track long term effects. This type of recommendation implies a long term monitoring effort with associated hydrology data storage technologies for meta-data, and timeseries data. And in addition to these usual types of data, the temportal aspect of risk should also thereofre be stored. 


The attempt to integrate these enhancements in Australia has highlighted legislative and technical gaps. It is the intention of this review to document some of these gaps as noted in the literature, and within the technical community. Finally, potential solutions are proposed as a goals for future research with specific interest in the visualisation of risk as a management tool.

## Proposed Legislative Enhancements





## Risk Management 

According to Baker et al, risk management consists of risk analysis, evaluation and control [@Baker1998].

#### Make Good Agreements (MGA) and Make Good Measures (MGM)

"A make good agreement is an arrangement between a tenure holder and water bore owner" [@EHP2013, p.2]. Make good measures applies if the relevant authority believes that a bore is impaired. 
A make good measure is the measure a petroleum tenure holder will take if a bore has an impaired capacity. [@EHP2013, p.2]. An impairment will (should) be documents in a bore report, and can be when a bore no longer supplies a reasonable quantity or quality of water for its authorised use or purpose, with the ultimate arbiter being the governing chief executive [@QSG].

As noted by the EHP, these measures can include works on the bore, such as deepening, where the costs of words is borne by the petroleum tenure holder (PTH). Or alternately, the petroleum tenure holder may provide the water bore owner monetary compensation.


#### Make Good Risk in Unit Technical Cost

For landholders and the PTH, the dollar consequence of any impairment to a bore is quantified in the MGM. Hence the risk, in this instance is the probability of the impairment, and the MGM dollar cost: 

\[
	\begin{align} 
	R_{MG} = \text{Make Good Risk} 
	& P(I) =  \text{Probability of Impairment}
	& C_{MGM} = \text{$ Consequence of Make Good Measure}	
	& R_{MG} = P(\mathit{I}) . C_{MGM} \label{ref1}
	\end{align} 
\]


For simplicity sake, when calculating the Unit Technical Cost (UTC) of operations, C_MGM is set to the dollar value of the groundwater bore license. MGM works on the bore may exceed the license value in some cases, however some impairments are difficult to predict *a priori*, and so the bore license value assumes *de facto* liability for UTC calculations. 

# Risk and Liability

There are gaps in the approaches above, the main issue in arriving at a unified risk framework appears to be: 
The gap identified by the literature appears to be the connection between GMMCA risk assessment and the make good measures. 

Whilst they have their place as a behavioral heuristic in the enforcement of safety procedures, the qualitative risk assessment methodology, with risk levels assigned through expert opinion, does not typically have a dollar value attached. This makes NPV and PV estimations of financial liability difficult to quantify. 






  

In the calculation above, Make Good Risk (R_MG) has a dollar value attached. In the case of repair works, the cost of MGM's can only truly be known *ex post facto*, for example, after an invoice has been received. -- [Footnote] To the knowledge of the author, there is no provision in the Harmonised Risk Management Framework (HRMF) for the recovery of data on MGM costs. This makes *post hoc* analysis a difficult task.-- However most stakeholders are not interested in *post hoc* analysis, but rather, the *ex ante* liability, the liability before the event to calculate ROI, and determine resource economics. 

This is especially the case for a PTH in the calculation of UTC, which typically includes decommissioning costs, and, in the case of CSG, any MGM costs. The default case mentioned above, of assigning C_MGM to the bore license value is one way of quantifying *ex ante* liability. Whether or not the license value has parity with MGM costs is moot, until such time as an MGM is fully executed. 

Pegging Make Good Risk to the bore license value transfers the burden of consequence calculation to the license issuer.

ensuring the bore owner has access to a reasonable quantity and quality of water for the bore's authorised use or purpose;
Examples —
bore enhancement by deepening the bore or improving its pumping capacity

providing a supply of an equivalent amount of water of a suitable quality by piping it from an alternative source
(b) carrying out a plan to monitor the bore, including, for example, by undertaking periodic bore assessments;
(c) giving the bore owner monetary or non-monetary compensation for the bore's impaired capacity.

## Technical Context

The prevailing Technical Context (TC) might be characterised by three different approaches to the task of providing a data system capable of meeting the requirements of risk management.

``` 
1. in-house technical  
2. out-sourced vendor  
3. hybrid 

```

In #3, the hybrid situation, the data system is typically maintained by a team of subject experts together with a system administrator.


Whilst there are many data software applications currently available within the industry (Aquarius is one), typically at a State Government level the Hydstra(TM) data system developed and maintained by Kisters Pty Ltd, is the defacto standard for rainfall and stream level data. Some States or Local Government entities use different software systems, however Hydstra is predominantly the main system.  

Hydstra is also used at the national level within the BoM, however two other systems are also used; the in-house AWRIS2 developed as apart of the hydrographic modernisation project, and the WISKI(TM) system manufactured by the European branch of Kisters (Kisters AGM). 

The situation is a little more diverse when it comes to Groundwater and Water Quality. There are several systems such as Equis, EnviroSys, HydSys, and in Queensland there is the well-known Ground Water Database (GWDB) developed and maintainted in-house within the QLD NRM. An inventory of all the known systems is available below.

## Conclusions and Future Work

This review has focuses on the regulatory frameworks which have been concieved to provide effective management of the risks associated with Unconventional Energy production.

The design intent of the legislative concepts appears to necessitate a technical legislative framework to store and integrate many different dtata types over time. Such a framework is the main interest for future work. The three novel technical goals of that work envisiaged are; 

1. Proof of concept for a technical framework, which enables;
2. The integration of the temporal component of risk into precautionary and adaptive measures, and
3. The integration of model uncertainty into the calculation of risk.

Coal Seam CSG exploration and production (hereafter, CSG operations) raise community concern due to the potential impacts on long-term food security, water resources, public health and individual property rights for the sake of mining royalties, economic growth and employment opportunities


## What is Risk?

Risk is the product of probability and consequence

The national water commission identified the following potential risks to sustainable water management:

Extracting large volumes of low-quality water will impact on connected surface and
groundwater systems, some of which may already be fully or overallocated, including the
Great Artesian Basin and Murray-Darling Basin.
Impacts on other water users and the environment may occur due to the dramatic
depressurisation of the coal seam, including:
o changes in pressures of adjacent aquifers with consequential changes in water
availability
o reductions in surface water flows in connected systems
o land subsidence over large areas, affecting surface water systems, ecosystems,
irrigation and grazing lands.
The production of large volumes of treated waste water, if released to surface water
systems, could alter natural flow patterns and have significant impacts on water quality, and
river and wetland health. There is an associated risk that, if the water is overly treated, ‘clean
water’ pollution of naturally turbid systems may occur.
The practice of hydraulic fracturing, or fraccing, to increase gas output, has the potential to
induce connection and cross-contamination between aquifers, with impacts on groundwater
quality.
The reinjection of treated waste water into other aquifers has the potential to change the
beneficial use characteristics of those aquifers.

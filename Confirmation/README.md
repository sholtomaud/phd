### Project title
#### Data Capture and Visualisation for Unconventional Energy Risk Governance

### Summary of Project
NGO, State, National, Commonwealth and industry bodies have proposed different components of a management framework aiming to effectively govern risks in unconventional energy production. This study aims to 1) clarify the legislative, calculative and technical requirements for such a system, and 2) investigate new technologies which may reduce the cost and time-to-market to meet such requirements. To this extent, the goal is to develop a minimal viable product (MVP) meeting the requirements identified in 1). This will be achieved through review of the legislative, mathematical/engineering and data systems literature together with concurrent code development and collaboration with Government and Corporate entities. The concurrent code development will employ the reactive responsive development philosophy, and the requirements and legislative review will be taken under a broader concept of 'Risk Governance'.

### Economic, environmental and/or social benefits

The main potential benefits identified with this project are A) cost reductions, B) communicative transparency, and C) effective governance.  

A) In identifying recent and emerging technology, it is anticipated that a data capture and visualisation system can be developed and maintained at minimal costs (potentially orders of magnitude) and greater functionality with less time-to-market compared to alternative technology and development models.  
B) Perhaps the most significant, non-operational issue faced by any large-scale unconventional energy production are those of social and political license. "To be seen to be doing the right thing" regarding obligations to the community and environment. By capturing stakeholder requirements, the proposed data system aims to enable stakeholders to see what is being done.

C) Effective risk governance is not just a matter of perception, but also a matter of actually doing the right thing, and being able to manage any issues which may occur when an accident or failure happens. Hence the data system aims to increase the ability to effectively govern, but also investigate the question of what effective risk governance is for stakeholders, and integrate this back into the system.

# Project Outcomes

### High Level Goals

There are two high level project outcomes targeted. 

1. Effective Risk Governance Innovation 
2. Investigate whether technical innovation can be made using bigdata technologies for data capture, analysis and visualisation 

These high level outcomes are broken down into more specific project goals below, however it is planned to undertake the thesis by letters, so each chapter will be a discrete article addressing aspects of the low-level goals.

### Low Level Goals

#### Methodological Goals

In order to meet the objectives noted above, it is anticipated that the thesis will involved the investigation of novel methodologies. Whilst the target area is initially limited to Groundwater Level, it is anticipated that any innovations might be generalised.

```
* A method for turning risk & reliability into time series
* A method for forecasting potential impacts
* A method for evaluating effectiveness of risk governance
```

#### Technical Goals

Notwithstanding any emergent gaps or requirements emanating from the technical review, the technical goals are:

```
* Technology for integration of different data models, Hydstra & GWDB, Equis etc., into a cloud-based unstructured BigData system (e.g. MongoDB, Cassandra, etc.)
* Data capture through desktop and mobile app forms
* Visualisation and risk data analysis with D3.js and Leaflet.js technologies
```

# Requirements

## Component 1

The goal of the first aim is to identify;

1. Requirements
2. Gaps
3. Solutions 

In the current/proposed legislation and literature on risk management frameworks, which may provide gaps or challenges to the successful deployment of a framework.

As interpreted here, the high level requirements for such a framework are:

* System for managing and monitoring risk
* System for integrating data relevant to management and monitoring of risk
  
## Component 2

The goal of the second aim is to test and develop a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) which enables services to be provided as a part of this management framework. Included within the MVP are 
arcitechtural considerations regarding integration of disparate data model requirements, and a visualisation of the MVP services to demonstrate the capability of the services.



 A reactive development philosophy has been used for the development process [@Reactive2014]. This philosophy embraces the concept of continual data model improvement and change at minimal effort.

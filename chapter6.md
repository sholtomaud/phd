# Preface

This PhD began with technical motivations to 

1. bring together a number of different technologies and databases that store water data
2. generate services which value add to those technologies

The latter of these motivations implied the analysis and generation of novel services such as providing risking of assets associated with unconventional energy resources such as Coal Seam Gas production (CGS)

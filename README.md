# Data-driven Systems for Global Risk Governance of Unconventional Energy: Information System Requirements and Development with application to Groundwater Resources

#### Doctoral Candidate 
Mr Sholto Maud

# INTRODUCTION AND CONTEXT
There are many database models in the water industry, both vendor-based and in-house. These different models provide an integration challenge when aiming to provide higher level services such as risking services. A translation is needed to bring different models them together into one system which can enable a portfolio of effective risk governance services. 

# AIMS AND OBJECTIVES
The thesis is at the highest level an investigation into both system engineering and system design to accommodate the objective of integrating multiple data models for the purpose of risk governance in the unconventional energy industry.

The aims within this objective is to enable web services for risk governance portfolio for stakeholders. The types of risk under interest are: cumulative, ecoservices, compliance, financial with the potential for expansion. Within the goals the aims are to generate: 

* Geopoint services acquiring data from legacy systems
* Data models meta-translation service for schema integration
* Risk acquisition & attribution through forms & calculation services, turning risk into a timeseries
* Global risk governance portfolio
* 2D maps for proof of concept demonstration

### Research Question
Can we use big data and data-driven interfaces to leverage global risk governance requirements for water and unconventional energy production at reduced cost?

### Hypotheses

* That with NoSQL we can integrate different data models at reduced cost
* That data-driven interfaces can meet stakeholder requirements more effectively

# RESEARCH PLAN

As an investigation into both system engineering and design the research plan will cover both regulatory and information topics and practical tasks of development. Theoretical topics include Risk Assessment and how Assessment relates to Risk Governance in the unconventional energy industry. Practical tasks will involve coding and deployment of Minimum Viable Products. The main methods used in the practical aspect of the plan will be kind of reactive development. 

These topics and tasks will be the subject of 5 articles and one literature review, each of which will comprise a chapter in the overall Thesis. The specific chapter headings and content may be subject to change, but proposed headings, and article titles are designated with an asterisk below:

# RESOURCES & SKILLS 
The following skills will be required for the successful completion of the project:
* NoSQL
* Understanding of Effective Risk Governance Model
* Big Data Systems (MongoDB)
* Data analysis 
* Node.js
* Data driven interfaces
* DevOps

# BARRIERS TO SUCCESS
The main barriers to success will be skill & system development within timelines. Developing techniques for handling non-standardised data formats are significant challenges along with  engagement with Government agencies that are the source of these data model variability. Technical expertise will be developed during the course of the project to accommodated any skill gaps in Node.js and NoSQL systems.

# CONTRIBUTIONS TO KNOWLEDGE (THE TATEMENT OF ORIGINALITY)

The project will contribute further understanding around the applicability of unstructured persistence and data-driven interfaces to the regulation of hydrology & hydrogeology. It will establish more specific knowledge around the cost and potential for resource efficiencies that might be obtained in the use of such technologies.

# Project title

#### BigData Capture, Reporting and Visualisation for Unconventional Energy Risk Governance

# Summary of Project

Various NGO, State, National, Commonwealth and industry bodies have proposed different components of a management framework aiming to effectively govern risks in unconventional energy production. Under the broad concept of 'Risk Governance', this RhD project aims to 1) clarify the legislative, calculative and technical requirements for such a risk governance system, and 2) investigate new technologies which may reduce the cost and time-to-market to meet such requirements up to the point of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP).  This will be achieved through review of the legislative, mathematical/ engineering and data systems literature together with concurrent code development. It will include collaboration with Government and Corporate entities, employing a reactive development philosophy to respond to changing or emerging requirements.

# Research problem 

1. Many data models and data formats that need to be integrated
2. Many data, compliance & reporting requirements for Unconventional Energy
3. Previous approaches costly
4. Effective Risk Governance compromised by 1-3 
5. Are there technologies and methods that can help resolve these issues in a costly and timeliness manner?

# Problem resolution

1. Clarify the scope of legislative, calculative and technical requirements for risk governance system that satisfies stakeholder requirements, and 
2. Investigate new technologies (BigData, NoSQL, Data-driven UIs) which may reduce the cost and time-to-market to meet such requirements up to the point of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

# Economic, environmental and/or social benefits

The main potential benefits identified with this project are A) cost reductions, B) increases in communicative transparency, and C) improvement in effective governance.  

A. In identifying recent and emerging technology, it is anticipated that a data capture and visualisation system can be developed and maintained at minimal costs (potentially orders of magnitude compared to other approaches) and greater functionality, with less time-to-market compared to alternative technology and development models.

B. One of the most significant, non-operational, issues faced by any large-scale unconventional energy production is that of social and political license. "To be seen to be doing the right thing" regarding obligations to the community and environment. Using a broad definition of "stakeholder" to include public entities, requirements will be captured that aim to increase the transparency for stakeholders so they can see what is being done.

C. Effective risk governance is not just a matter of perceptions, but also a matter of actually doing the right thing, and being able to manage any issues which may occur when an accident or failure happens. Hence the data system aims to increase the ability to govern effectively. The research will therefore investigate the question of how effective risk governance is measured and assessed by stakeholders, and integrate this back into the system.

# Project Outcomes

### High Level Goals

There are two high level project outcomes targeted. 

1. Effective Risk Governance Innovation 
2. Investigate whether technical innovation can be made using bigdata technologies for data capture, analysis, reporting and visualisation 

These high level outcomes are broken down into more specific project goals below, however it is planned to undertake the thesis by letters, so each thesis chapter will be a discrete article addressing aspects of the low-level goals. Within the context of these outcomes, the purpose of the literature review is to identify the appropriate requirements for an unconventional energy production risk governance information technology. Whilst the technology might be generically engineered to address risk governance over any environmental or technical asset, it is applied to a specific asset at risk which is groundwater.

### Low Level Goals

#### Methodological Goals

In order to meet the objectives noted above, it is anticipated that the thesis will involved the investigation of novel methodologies. Whilst the target area is initially limited to Groundwater Level, it is anticipated that any innovations might be generalised.

* A method for turning risk & reliability into time series
* A method for forecasting potential impacts
* A method for evaluating effectiveness of risk governance

#### Technical Goals

Notwithstanding any emergent gaps or requirements emanating from the technical review, the technical goals are:

* Ability to translate different data models from vendor and non-vendor based systems into one system 
* Data capture through desktop and mobile app forms
* Off-line field data entry
* Data-driven UI
* Risk visualisation and data reporting

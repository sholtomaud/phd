# Project title

```
 Visualisation of Groundwater Risk for Unconventional Energy production   

```


# Summary of Project

```
 A rigorous management framework has been proposed by various NGO, state, commonwealth and industry bodies for the effective management of groundwater risk in unconventional energy production. This study aims to 1) clarify the legislative, calculative and technical requirements for such a system, and 2) undertake a minimal viable product (MVP)development to the point of pre-commercialisation. This will be achieved through review of the legislative, mathematical/engineering and data systems literature and concurrent code development with various go/no-go gates.

```

# Requirements

## Component 1

The goal of the first aim is to identify any gaps in the current/proposed legislation and literature on risk management frameworks, which may provide gaps or challenges to the successful deployment of the said framework. ,
